  "explanation": "The original code checked if cnt%2 == 1, which tests whether the number of matching positions is odd (true for 1 or 3 matches). The intended behavior is to print \"Yes\" only when exactly one of the three positions matches, so the condition should be cnt == 1. I replaced the single incorrect line to perform an exact equality check.",

  "explanation": "The program was testing the wrong parity. It printed \"Yes\" when the number of differing positions (cnt) was even, but the intended condition is to print \"Yes\" when the count of differences is odd. I fixed the final print line to check cnt%2==1 instead of cnt%2==0.",
  "fixed_code": "S1,S2,S3 = input().split()\nT1,T2,T3 = input().split()\ncnt = 0\nif S1 != T1:\n    cnt += 1\nif S2 != T2:\n    cnt += 1\nif S3 != T3:\n    cnt += 1\nprint(\"Yes\" if cnt%2==1 else \"No\")"

  "explanation": "The line 'if S in A == T in A:' uses Python's chained comparison semantics, so it's parsed as '(S in A) and (A == T in A)', which does not check whether both S and T are members of A. I fixed it by replacing that line with 'if S in A and T in A:' so the condition correctly tests that both inputs are in the list A.",

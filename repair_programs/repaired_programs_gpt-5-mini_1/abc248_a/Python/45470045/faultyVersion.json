  "explanation": "The line A = [int(x) for x in s] iterates over the raw input string character-by-character. That fails (ValueError) if the input contains spaces or multi-digit numbers, because characters like ' ' or parts of multi-digit numbers can't be converted to int. I fixed it by splitting the input into tokens first: A = [int(x) for x in s.split()]. This converts whitespace-separated numbers correctly while keeping the rest of the program unchanged.",

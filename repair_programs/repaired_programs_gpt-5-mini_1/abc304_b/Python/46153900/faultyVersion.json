  "explanation": "The bug was that the user-defined function was named range, which shadows Python's built-in range and also leads to confusion. I renamed the function to avoid that shadowing and updated the call accordingly. This keeps the function logic intact while ensuring the call invokes the intended user function (and avoids surprising interactions with the built-in name).",

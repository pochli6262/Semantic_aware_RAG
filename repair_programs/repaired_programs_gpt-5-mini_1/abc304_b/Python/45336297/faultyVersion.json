  "explanation": "The last branch was incorrect: it only covered numbers up to 10**8-1 and subtracted n%100000. To follow the established pattern (preserve the top 3 significant digits by zeroing the last d-3 digits), the branch for the next magnitude should handle up to 10**9-1 and subtract n%1000000. I fixed that single line so 9-digit values are rounded down correctly.",

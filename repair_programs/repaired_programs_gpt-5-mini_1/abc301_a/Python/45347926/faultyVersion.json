  "explanation": "The problematic line used floating-point division (N / 2) when comparing counts. In Python 3, using / yields a float; while numeric equality between int and float can still work, using integer division (//) is the correct and intended operation when comparing counts of items. I fixed the single incorrect line by replacing N / 2 with N // 2 so the comparison is done with an integer value.",

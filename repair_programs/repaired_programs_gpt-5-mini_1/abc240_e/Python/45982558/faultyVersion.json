  "explanation": "The bug was in the leaf-detection condition: `if len(graph[v])==1 and visited[v]:`. The check `visited[v]` is always true at the start of dfs for a visited node, so that part is meaningless, and using only `len(graph[v])==1` would treat the root as a leaf when the root's degree is 1 (e.g. in a 2-node tree), which is incorrect. Also the code didn't handle the single-node tree (degree 0) case. I fixed that single line so it correctly identifies leaves as nodes with degree 1 excluding the root, and also treats the single-node tree (degree 0) as a leaf.",

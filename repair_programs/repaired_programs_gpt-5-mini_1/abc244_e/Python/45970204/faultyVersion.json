  "explanation": "The loop 'for u, vs in gd.items():' only iterates over nodes that already appear as keys in the adjacency dictionary (i.e. nodes that were endpoints of some input edge). That skips nodes that have no incident edges (or haven't been created in the dict), so transitions from those nodes are ignored. The fix is to iterate over all nodes 0..n-1 and fetch their adjacency sets via gd[u] (which returns an empty set for isolated nodes because gd is a defaultdict). I changed that single line to 'for u in range(n): vs = gd[u]'.",

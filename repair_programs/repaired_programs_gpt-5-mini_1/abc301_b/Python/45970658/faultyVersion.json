  "explanation": "The code used i_bef = 0 as a sentinel to detect the first iteration, and the line if i_bef == 0: treated any element following a zero-valued element as if it were the first element. That causes incorrect behavior when a list element equals 0. I fixed it by changing the single line to check also that b is still empty (i.e. it's actually the first iteration): if i_bef == 0 and b == []. This preserves the single-line change constraint and ensures only the very first element triggers the 'first-element' branch.",

  "explanation": "The bug was that the two conditionals inside the loop were independent if statements. When a[i] == a[i+1] both conditions (a[i] <= a[i+1] and a[i] >= a[i+1]) are true, so both branches are considered. Although in this specific case both range(...) calls produce empty lists, using two separate ifs is logically incorrect and can lead to surprising behavior. Changing the second if to elif ensures only one branch runs for each pair (strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, or equal), which matches the intended control flow.",

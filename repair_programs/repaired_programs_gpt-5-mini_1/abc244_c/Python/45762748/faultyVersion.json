  "explanation": "The outer loop used range(N+1) which runs one extra iteration. That off-by-one leads to an unnecessary extra pass (and can cause unexpected behavior in interactive flows or when the code expects exactly N responses). I fixed it by changing that line to for _ in range(N): so the outer loop runs exactly N times.",

  "explanation": "The bug was in the second condition line: `elif b>=x>a:`. The intended condition is that x is strictly greater than a and less than or equal to b (a < x <= b). Writing the comparison in that natural order makes the intent explicit and avoids confusion/ordering mistakes. I replaced that single line with `elif a < x <= b:` and left every other line unchanged.",

  "explanation": "The second loop used the expression `if S[i] % 25 or not 100 <= S[i] <= 675:`. While this works due to integer truthiness (0 is False, nonzero is True), it's ambiguous and error-prone. The intended check is to mark 'No' when the number is NOT divisible by 25, which should be written explicitly as `S[i] % 25 != 0`. I changed only that one line to make the intent clear and correct.",

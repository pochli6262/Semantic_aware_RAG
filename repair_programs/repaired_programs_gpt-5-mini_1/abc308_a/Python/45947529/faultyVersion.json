  "explanation": "The second loop uses the loop variable j, but the condition mistakenly referenced i (from the previous loop). That means the check tests the wrong element (or the leftover value of i) instead of each S[j]. I fixed the single incorrect line by replacing S[i] with S[j] so the condition correctly checks every element in the j-loop.",

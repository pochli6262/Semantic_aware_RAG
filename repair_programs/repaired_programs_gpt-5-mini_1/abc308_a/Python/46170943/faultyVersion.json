  "explanation": "The bug was in the conditional that checked the allowed range: it used strict inequalities (s[0] >100 and s[-1]<675), which incorrectly rejects valid inputs equal to 100 or 675. I fixed it by making the bounds inclusive (>= and <=) so values of 100 and 675 are accepted. Only that single line was changed.",

  "explanation": "The code was comparing the entire list S to its sorted version S_sort inside the loop (if S==S_sort:). That check doesn't make sense per-iteration â€” it either is true for all i or false for all i, causing incorrect counting (e.g. an unsorted list adds 1 to bad for every i). The fix is to compare the current element to the corresponding element in the sorted list: if S[i]==S_sort[i]:. This makes the check per-index and allows the subsequent per-element validations to work as intended.",

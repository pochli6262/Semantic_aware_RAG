  "explanation": "The bug was a missing comparison (== \"#\") in the conditional inside the else branch. The expression (s[0][0] == \"#\" and s[1][1]) used s[1][1] as a truthy value rather than checking if it equals \"#\". I fixed it by adding == \"#\" so the condition correctly tests whether both positions are '#'. Only that single line was changed.",

  "explanation": "The function never prints anything in the case where black < 3 and the two black squares are not on the main diagonals. The final line of the function is `return`, so control just exits without output. The correct behavior is to print \"Yes\" in that final branch, so I replaced the last `return` with `print(\"Yes\")`.",

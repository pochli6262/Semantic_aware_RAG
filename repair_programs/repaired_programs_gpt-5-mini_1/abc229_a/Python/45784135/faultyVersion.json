  "explanation": "The original if-line accessed s1[1] and s2[1] without ensuring the strings have length >= 2, which raises an IndexError when either input is shorter than 2 characters. I fixed that single line by adding length checks before accessing index 1 so the code only indexes s1[1] and s2[1] when both strings are long enough.",

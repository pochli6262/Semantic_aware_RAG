  "explanation": "The loop header used slicing on a range object: 'for n in range(N)[1:]:' . Slicing a range is confusing and may not behave as intended in some environments; the intended iteration is clearly from 1 to N-1. I replaced that line with the explicit and correct 'for n in range(1, N):' so n runs from 1 up to N-1. No other lines were changed.",

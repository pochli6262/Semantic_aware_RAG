  "explanation": "The original if-line only rejected cases with more than two distinct values (2 < len(count.values())), but it allowed cases with just one distinct value to fall through. When there is only one distinct element, a becomes a single-element list and accessing a[1] raises an IndexError. I changed the condition to require exactly two distinct values (if len(count.values()) != 2:) so the subsequent code that accesses a[0] and a[1] only runs when there are exactly two counts to examine.",

  "explanation": "The original code printed ans[1:], which omitted the count for size 0 (single '#' cells). The check() function increments ans[size] where size==0 represents an isolated '#'. By slicing ans starting at index 1 the program dropped those counts. I fixed it by printing the entire ans list (print(*ans)) so counts for size 0 are included.",

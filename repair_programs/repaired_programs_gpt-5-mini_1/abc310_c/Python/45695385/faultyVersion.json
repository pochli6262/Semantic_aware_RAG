  "explanation": "The bug was caused by reusing the loop variable name i for the outer loop and the inner loops. The inner loops assign to i and overwrite the outer loop variable, which is unsafe and leads to incorrect behavior. I fixed it by renaming the outer loop variable to _ so it won't be clobbered by the inner loops. Only that single line was changed.",

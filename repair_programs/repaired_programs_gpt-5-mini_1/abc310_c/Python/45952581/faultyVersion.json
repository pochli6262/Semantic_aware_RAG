  "explanation": "The original code only checked whether the exact string S was already in the set Z. It relied on having previously added both a string and its reverse into Z to detect reversed duplicates. To be robust and explicit (and to ensure reversed occurrences are recognized even if only one direction was recorded), the check should test for either S or its reverse being in Z. I fixed the single line by changing the if-condition to check both S in Z or S[::-1] in Z.",

  "explanation": "The bug was that the code was subtracting the current bit's value from min_val when it encountered a '1' (the line `if ch == '1': min_val -= mask`). That changed the baseline minimal value (min_val) mid-iteration and caused later decisions about setting '?' bits to be evaluated against the wrong baseline, allowing choices that made the final number exceed n. The simplest fix — changing that single line so we do not modify min_val for '1' bits — preserves min_val as the initial baseline (all '?' as 0) while the code uses n (reduced when choosing '?' bits) as the remaining budget. I fixed it by replacing the subtraction with a no-op (pass) so only one line was changed and the rest of the program is unchanged.",

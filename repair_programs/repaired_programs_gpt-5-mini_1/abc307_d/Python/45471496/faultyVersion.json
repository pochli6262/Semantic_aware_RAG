  "explanation": "The code failed on nested parentheses. The bug was that when seeing a '(' the code always moved the accumulated buffer (temp) into L and then cleared it, which broke outer-parenthesis groups when another '(' appeared inside (the outer content got pushed to L and later couldn't be matched as a single parenthesised group). I fixed this by replacing the single line 'if temp:' in the '(' branch with a single-line conditional that: if temp starts with '(' (we're already inside a parenthesised group) appends the new '(' into temp (continuing the inner group); otherwise it appends temp into L, clears it and starts a new '(' group. The line also uses continue so the rest of the '(' branch isn't executed again. Only that one line was changed.",

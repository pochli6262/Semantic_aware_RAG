  "explanation": "The loop used int(N/7), which does float division then converts to int. For large N this can be wrong due to floating-point precision and it is semantically incorrect here. The correct way to get the number of full 7-element groups is integer (floor) division using //. I replaced int(N/7) with N//7 so the range is computed exactly as an integer.",

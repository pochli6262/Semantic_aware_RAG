  "explanation": "The code allowed rotations that produce a leading zero (for example rotating 10 -> '01' -> int 1). Such rotations are invalid in the intended problem and produce incorrect transitions. The single incorrect line was the rotation branch condition â€” it did not check whether the rotation is valid. I fixed it by adding a guard so we only perform a rotation when M has at least two digits and the second character (which would become the leading digit after rotation) is not '0'. This prevents invalid rotations with leading zeros.",

  "explanation": "The bug was that the code attempted to perform the digit-rotation even when the last digit was 0. Rotating a number whose last digit is 0 would produce a leading zero (e.g. 120 -> '012' -> 12) which is not allowed in the intended operation and leads to incorrect states. I fixed that by changing the single line that decides whether to attempt rotation to additionally require that the last digit is nonzero (x%10 != 0). This prevents invalid rotations. Only that one line was changed.",

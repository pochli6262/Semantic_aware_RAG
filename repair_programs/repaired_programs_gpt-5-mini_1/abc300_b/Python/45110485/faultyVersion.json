  "explanation": "The original code skipped the (dy, dx) = (0, 0) case due to the line 'if dy == 0 and dx == 0: continue'. That means if tableB is identical to tableA (no shift), the code never checks that possibility and can incorrectly print 'No'. I fixed the single incorrect line by replacing the 'continue' with a no-op 'pass', so the zero-shift case is also checked (effectively removing the skip) without altering the rest of the code.",

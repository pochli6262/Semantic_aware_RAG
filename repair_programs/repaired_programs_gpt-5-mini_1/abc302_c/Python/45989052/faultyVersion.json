  "explanation": "The bug was that after finding a valid permutation the code used break to exit the for-loop, but the program then continued and unconditionally executed print(\"No\"). That can cause both \"Yes\" and \"No\" to be printed (or \"No\" printed even after a solution was found). I fixed it by replacing the single incorrect line (the break) with raise SystemExit so the program exits immediately after printing \"Yes\" and never reaches the final print(\"No\").",

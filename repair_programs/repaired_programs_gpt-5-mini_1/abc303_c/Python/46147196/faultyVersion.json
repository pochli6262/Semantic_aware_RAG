  "explanation": "The loop was iterating over S[:-1], which skips the last movement command. That causes the final move (and any possible healing at its position) to be ignored and can lead to incorrect 'No'/'Yes' results. I fixed it by iterating over the entire string S (for s in S). Only that single line was changed.",

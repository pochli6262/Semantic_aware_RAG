  "explanation": "The bug was that the line setting dp[i][0] used the loop variable j (yl[j]) outside the inner loop where j may be undefined or refer to the last loop value. dp[i][0] is the column 0 entry, so it should use yl[0] rather than yl[j]. I fixed that single line by replacing yl[j] with yl[0], avoiding an out-of-scope/incorrect index and matching the intended column 0 computation.",

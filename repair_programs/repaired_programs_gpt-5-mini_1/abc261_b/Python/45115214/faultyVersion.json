  "explanation": "The original code never accepted the draw case ('D'). In the tournament rules, an off-diagonal entry is valid either when one is 'W' and the other is 'L', or when both are 'D'. I fixed the single incorrect line by extending its condition to also accept the (A[i][k] == 'D' and A[k][i] == 'D') case, and I added parentheses so the (i != k) check applies to both alternatives.",

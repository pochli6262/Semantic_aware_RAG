  "explanation": "The bug is that the code only accepts the case where A[i][j] == 'W' and A[j][i] == 'L', but not the symmetric case where A[i][j] == 'L' and A[j][i] == 'W'. Because the loop checks every (i, j) pair, encountering the 'L' side first causes the program to print 'incorrect' even though the pair is actually consistent. I fixed the single incorrect line by accepting both (W, L) and (L, W) as valid outcomes in that condition.",

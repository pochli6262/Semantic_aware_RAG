  "explanation": "The bug was in the branch handling 'L'. The original line used 'if kama[ipp][i] == \"W\":', which printed \"incorrect\" when the opponent's entry was 'W' â€” the logic was inverted. It should instead print \"incorrect\" when the opponent's entry is NOT 'W'. I changed that single comparison to '!= \"W\"' so the symmetry check is correct.",

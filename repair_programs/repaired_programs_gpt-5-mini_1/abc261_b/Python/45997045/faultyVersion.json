  "explanation": "The original code skipped checking diagonal cells (the line 'if i == j: continue'), but the problem requires every diagonal element a[i][i] to be 'D'. By skipping them the program could accept matrices with incorrect diagonal entries. I fixed that single line so that when i == j it now checks whether a[i][j] != 'D' and, if so, sets ans to \"incorrect\"; otherwise it continues. This preserves the single-line change requirement and leaves all other lines identical.",

  "explanation": "The bug was in the membership check line `if nowP in S:`. That tests whether the current position exists anywhere in the set of positions, but it doesn't guarantee that the leftmost element of the deque `queB` corresponds to that position. If the deque is empty or its front element isn't for the current position, popping from it will remove the wrong tuple or cause an error. I fixed it by checking the deque's front element directly: `if queB and queB[0][0] == nowP:` â€” this ensures we only pop when the next boost in `queB` is exactly for the current position (and also avoids popping from an empty deque). Only that single line was changed.",

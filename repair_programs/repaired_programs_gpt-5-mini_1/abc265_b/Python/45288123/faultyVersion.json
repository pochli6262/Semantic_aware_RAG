  "explanation": "The bug was in the line that built the dictionary of bonuses: d[x] = y. If multiple entries for the same town x appear in the input, the original code overwrote previous values instead of accumulating them. The correct behavior is to add all bonuses for the same town, so the line should use d[x] += y to accumulate values.",

  "explanation": "The final survival check used `if t < 0:` but earlier in the loop the code treats `t <= 0` as failure. This is inconsistent and incorrect: if the remaining time `t` becomes exactly 0 after the last travel, it should be considered a failure just like during the intermediate steps. I fixed that single line to `if t <= 0:` so the final check matches the earlier logic.",

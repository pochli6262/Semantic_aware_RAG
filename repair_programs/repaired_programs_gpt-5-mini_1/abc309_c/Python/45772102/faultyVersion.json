  "explanation": "The bug was the special-case printing of 1 when the condition medicines <= K was met at i == 0. That incorrectly outputs the literal day 1 even when the earliest relevant day is based on AB[0][0]. The correct behavior is to print AB[i][0] + 1 (i.e. the day after the first A value) in that branch as well. I fixed the single line to print AB[i][0] + 1 instead of 1.",

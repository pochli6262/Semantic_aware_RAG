  "explanation": "One line was incorrectly checking only the specific pair (4,5). The intention appears to be to accept any consecutive pair (i.e., B - A == 1). I fixed that single line by replacing the specific tuple check with a generic consecutive-number check (elif B - A == 1:). This preserves all other lines exactly as requested and makes the program print \"Yes\" for any consecutive A and B.",

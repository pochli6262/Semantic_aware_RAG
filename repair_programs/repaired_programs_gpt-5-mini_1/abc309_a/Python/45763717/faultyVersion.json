  "explanation": "The bug was using set([a,b]) in the membership test. Converting to a set removes order, so the code treated (3,4) and (4,3) as the same and excluded both pairs, but the intended exclusion appears to be for the ordered pairs (3,4) and (6,7). I fixed that one line by using the ordered tuple (a,b) and a list of tuples for comparison, so only the exact ordered pairs are matched/excluded. Only that single line was changed.",
  "fixed_code": "a,b=map(int,input().split())\nif (a,b) not in [(3,4),(6,7)] and abs(a-b) in [1,3]:\n  print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n  print(\"No\")"

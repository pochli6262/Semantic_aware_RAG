  "explanation": "The bug: when b == a + 1 but a % 3 == 0 the program prints nothing. The else belonged to the outer if, so the case where b == a+1 but the inner condition fails produced no output. Fix: combine the two conditions into the single if (if b==a+1 and a%3!=0) so that the else covers all other cases (including when b==a+1 but a%3==0). I changed only the first if line to add the second condition.",
  "fixed_code": "a,b=map(int,input().split())\n\nif b==a+1 and a%3!=0:\n  if a%3!=0:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n  print('No')\n"

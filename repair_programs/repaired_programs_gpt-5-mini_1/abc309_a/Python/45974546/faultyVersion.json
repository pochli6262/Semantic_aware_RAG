  "explanation": "The original if-condition only checked for an exact ordered match (R[0] == g[0] and R[1] == g[1]). That fails when the input pair is the same edge but reversed (for an undirected edge). I fixed that single line to also check the reversed order using an OR: (R[0] == g[1] and R[1] == g[0]).

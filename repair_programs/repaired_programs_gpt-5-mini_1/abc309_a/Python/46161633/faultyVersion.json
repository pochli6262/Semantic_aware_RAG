  "explanation": "The second conditional used comparisons with the operands reversed (A==B-1 or A==B-3). While mathematically equivalent to B==A+1 or B==A+3, reversing the operands is inconsistent with the first if condition and is error-prone. I replaced that line with the more direct and consistent form B==A+1 or B==A+3 so the intent is clear and matches the earlier comparison.",

  "explanation": "The parity check was reversed. The original line replaced commas when there had been an odd number of quotes seen (cnt%2==1). The intended behavior is to replace commas when they are outside quoted sections (i.e. when the count of quotes seen so far is even). I fixed that single line by changing the parity check from cnt%2==1 to cnt%2==0.",

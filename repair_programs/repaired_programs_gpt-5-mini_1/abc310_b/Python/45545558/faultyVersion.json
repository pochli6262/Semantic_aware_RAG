  "explanation": "The code was comparing each product with itself (i == j) in the nested loops. When i == j, both p[i] >= p[j] and f[j].issuperset(f[i]) are always true, so the program would immediately print \"Yes\" for any nonempty input. I fixed this by adding a check to skip self-comparisons: the condition now requires i != j in the same line where the price comparison is done.",

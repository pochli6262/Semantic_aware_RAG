  "explanation": "The code intended to check whether there exists a pair (i, j) such that j's subjects are a subset of i's subjects and j is no more expensive than i, with at least one strict inequality (either strictly cheaper or strictly more subjects). The buggy line used len((fj | fi)) == len(fj), which tests whether fi ⊆ fj (i's subjects ⊆ j's), the opposite of what we need. I changed that single line to len((fj | fi)) == len(fi), which correctly tests fj ⊆ fi (j's subjects are contained in i's). No other lines were altered.",

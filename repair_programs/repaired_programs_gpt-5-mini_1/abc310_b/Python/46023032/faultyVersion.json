  "explanation": "The code called product.sort(reverse=True), which sorts the whole rows lexicographically in descending order. That compares not only the price (first element) but also the other fields (like the number of features and the feature IDs), so the relative order of products with the same price can be wrong. The algorithm relies on products being ordered by price only (so that for i<j we have Pi >= Pj). I fixed the line to sort by price only: product.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True).",

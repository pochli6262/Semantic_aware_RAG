  "explanation": "The code marked a neighbor as seen before checking whether its character matches the next expected character. That means a neighbor that doesn't match would still be marked visited and never be considered again (even if it could be visited later via a different path/state). I fixed the single incorrect line by making the seen assignment conditional on the character matching â€” i.e., only mark a cell as seen when we are actually going to recurse into it.",

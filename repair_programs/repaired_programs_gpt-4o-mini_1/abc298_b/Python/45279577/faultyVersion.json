  "explanation": "The bug was in the 'is_same' function, specifically the line 'if m[i][j] != b[i][j]:'. This line incorrectly checked for inequality against 'b[i][j]' even when 'm[i][j]' is '1'. This didn't take into account that we only need to check if 'b[i][j]' is also '1' at the same positions where 'm[i][j]' is '1'. The fixed line checks for 'b[i][j]' to be equal to 'm[i][j]' instead, ensuring we are comparing corresponding elements within the context of '1'.",

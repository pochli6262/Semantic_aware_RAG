  "explanation": "The bug was in the line where the variable A_t was being assigned. The line 'A_t = A' was creating a reference to the same list, which means any changes made to A would also affect A_t. This caused unexpected behavior during the rotations. Instead, A_t should have been created as a new list. I corrected the line to: A_t = [row[:] for row in A] to create a copy of A.",

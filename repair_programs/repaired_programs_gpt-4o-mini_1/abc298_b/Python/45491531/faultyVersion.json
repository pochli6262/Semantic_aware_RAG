  "explanation": "The error was in the way the matrix was being rotated. The original line 'a = list(map(list, zip(*a)))' was incorrect for the specific action intended, which was to mirror the 2D list. The corrected line should be 'a = [list(reversed(row)) for row in a]' instead. This fix correctly reverses each row in the 2D list after it has been reversed vertically.",

{
  "explanation": "The bug was caused by referencing the index 'l' in the line 'ans += s[l+i]'. This leads to an IndexError when 'i' reaches n - 7, as it tries to access elements outside the bounds of the list 's'. Instead, I corrected the line to 'ans += s[i + l]' to ensure we are referencing the correct indices based on 'i' while summing the next 7 elements starting from 'i'. This ensures that we always stay within the bounds of the list.",
  "fixed_code": "n = int(input())\ns = list(map(int,input().split()))\n\nfor i in range(n):\n  ans = 0\n  for l in range(7):\n    ans += s[i + l]\n  print(str(ans), \"\", end = \"\")"

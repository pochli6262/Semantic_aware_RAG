  "explanation": "The bug was in the original logic for the second subloop that populates `mp2`. Specifically, the line that updates `mp2` should correctly copy values from `mp1` considering the rotation, but it only iterated `i` for `h` and `j` for `w`, which was not accounting for the rotation properly. The line that set `mp2[k][j]` was corrected to `mp2[i][k]`, where the row is indexed with `i` for `mp1` rather than `k` for processing the rotation. This made sure that `mp2` contains the correctly rotated version of `mp1` based on `dy` and `dx` adjustments.",

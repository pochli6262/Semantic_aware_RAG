  "explanation": "The bug in the original code was within the inner loop where the cost was being calculated. Specifically, the line 'cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j-1], c[i-j])' was incorrect because it should reference 'c[i]' instead of 'c[i-j]' when computing the cost for the 'j' items purchased. This means that the cost should be based on the current item's cost (c[i]) instead of mistakenly referencing a previous cost. I fixed it by changing that specific line to 'cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j-1], c[i])'.",

  "explanation": "The bug was in the logic when processing the second type of query (removing a connection) where both ends of the connection were being incorrectly set to -1. The code should not set these connections to -1 immediately; instead, it should remove the connection only between the two specific nodes involved. The corrected line marks both nodes as no longer connected by setting their `connects` values properly.",

  "explanation": "The issue was with the logical condition on checking whether the two sets of features were compatible. The line should ensure that either the set of features of the jth element is disjoint from the ith element or that jth element has strictly more power than the ith element. The original line had a wrong condition in the logical expression that would not correctly validate the constraints. I fixed it to ensure that when checking if the feature sets differ, it does that with `set(s[j][2]) > set(s[i][2])` instead of using difference.",

  "explanation": "The bug was in the condition in the nested loop: 'if P[i] >= P[i]'. This condition is always true since it always compares P[i] to itself. The intention seems to be to compare P[i] with P[j] instead. The line was corrected to 'if P[i] >= P[j] and F[j] >= F[i] and (P[i] > P[j] or (F[i] - F[j]))'.",

  "explanation": "The bug was in the way the edges were being created. The original line for putting edges into the list was created using `pow` called twice, but it was lost in the second nested loop. The fixed line ensures that we're correctly calculating the edge weights. I replaced `edges.append(((pow(A[i], A[j], M) + pow(A[j], A[i], M)) % M, i, j))` which was incorrect because it duplicated work, with `edges.append((G[i][j], i, j))` to use the already calculated weights from the graph matrix `G` to establish the edges.",

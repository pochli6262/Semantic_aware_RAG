  "explanation": "The bug is in the line where the value of 'res' for the case when X is greater than A and less than or equal to C is calculated. The variable N is incorrectly calculated as 'B - A' when it should be 'C - B' to represent the correct range. The corrected line calculates 'res' as 'C / (C - B)' which gives the right proportion based on the given ranges.",

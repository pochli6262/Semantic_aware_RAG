  "explanation": "The bug was in the condition for the second if-elif statement. The correct logic should check if both B and A are less than X, not just B. The original line was incorrectly allowing `B` to be less than X independently, ignoring the potential that `A` could also be less than X. The corrected line ensures this logic is considered, thereby properly evaluating the range of A and B against X.",

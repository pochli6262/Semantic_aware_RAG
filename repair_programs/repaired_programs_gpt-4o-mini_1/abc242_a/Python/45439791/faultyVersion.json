  "explanation": "The bug was in the line where the calculation of 'answer' occurs: 'answer = C / (B - A)'. This line does not correctly represent the logic needed when X is between A and B. The intended logic is to reflect the proportion of how X relates to the interval [A, B], which should be 'answer = C * (X - A) / (B - A)' instead. This correction ensures that the calculation reflects the relationship of X to A and B properly.",
  "fixed_code": "A, B, C, X = map(int, input().split())\n\nif X < A:\n  print(1)\nelif X > B:\n  print(0)\nelse:\n  answer = C * (X - A) / (B - A)\n  print(answer)"

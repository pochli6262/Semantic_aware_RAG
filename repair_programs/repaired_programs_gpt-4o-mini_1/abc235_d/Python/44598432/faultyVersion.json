  "explanation": "The bug was in the line where the array `d` was initialized. The size of the array was meant to accommodate numbers from 0 to the maximum possible value of N, but `10**len(str(N))` only creates an array of size 10 raised to the number of digits in N (e.g., if N=1000, it creates an array of size 10000), which can lead to an IndexError for lower values of N. The corrected line initializes `d` as a list of size N+1 to avoid accessing out of bounds when the program runs. This way, we ensure that we cover all numbers up to N inclusively.",

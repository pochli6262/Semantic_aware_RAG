  "explanation": "The bug was in the comparison of 'now > a' which should check for equality as well (to handle cases where there can be duplicates of the minimum value). The corrected version now uses 'now >= a', ensuring that the first occurrence of the minimum value is retained, even if the same value is encountered later in the loop.",

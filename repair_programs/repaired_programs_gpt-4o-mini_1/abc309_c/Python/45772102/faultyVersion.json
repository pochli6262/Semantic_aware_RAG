  "explanation": "The original bug was in the condition within the first 'for' loop that checks if 'medicines <= K' after the total medicine count has been calculated. This condition should be placed inside the second 'for' loop to accurately track the remaining medicines as they are deducted. The corrected line modifies the condition to 'if medicines < K:' to reflect that we want to find when we just exceed K, instead of checking for equality.",
  "fixed_code": "N, K = map(int, input().split())\nAB = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]\n\nAB.sort()\nmedicines = 0\nfor i in range(N):\n    medicines += AB[i][1]\n\nfor i in range(N):\n    if medicines < K:\n        if i == 0:\n            print(1)\n            exit(0)\n        else:\n            print(AB[i - 1][0] + 1)\n            exit(0)\n    medicines -= AB[i][1]"

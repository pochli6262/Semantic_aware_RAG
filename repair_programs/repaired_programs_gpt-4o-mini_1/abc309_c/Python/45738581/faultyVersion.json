  "explanation": "The bug was in the line 'arr.sort()'. The default sort function sorts the array of pairs by the first element in each pair, which is not the desired behavior. We want to sort by the second element (the amount). I corrected it to 'arr.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])' to ensure it sorts based on the value of 'tmp2'.",
  "fixed_code": "N, K = map(int, input().split())\narr = []\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(N):\n  tmp1, tmp2 = map(int, input().split())\n  arr.append([tmp1,tmp2])\n  total += tmp2\narr.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n\nif total < K:\n  print(1)\n  exit()\n\ni = 0\nwhile 1:\n  total -= arr[i][1]\n  if total <= K:\n    print(arr[i][0]+1)\n    exit()\n  i += 1"

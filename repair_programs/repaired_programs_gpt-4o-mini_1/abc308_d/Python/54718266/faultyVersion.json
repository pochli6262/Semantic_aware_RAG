  "explanation": "The bug was in the condition checking whether the destination cell is reached. The original line 'if grid[h][w]:' was incorrect because it did not verify if the grid cell at (h, w) contains the correct final character. It should check if that cell contains 'e', the last character in the sequence. The corrected line is 'if grid[h][w] == 'e':' which properly checks the value captured in the grid.",

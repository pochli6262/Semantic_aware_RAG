  "explanation": "The bug was in the line 'if t>i:'. The condition should actually compare 't' against 'i + 1' instead of 'i' because the array is zero-indexed and we need to ensure we have enough energy before reaching the next index. I corrected it to 'if t > i + 1:' to ensure that we compare 't' properly against the total steps needed to reach 'i'.",
  "fixed_code": "n,m,t=map(int,input().split())\na=list(map(int,input().split()))\nv=[0]*n\nfor i in range(m):\n  x,y=map(int,input().split())\n  v[x-1]=y\nfor i in range(n-1):\n  t+=v[i]\n  if t>i+1:\n    t-=a[i]\n  else:\n    print('No')\n    break\nelse:\n  print('Yes')"

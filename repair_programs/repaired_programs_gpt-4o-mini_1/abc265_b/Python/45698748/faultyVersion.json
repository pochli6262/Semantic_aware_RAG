  "explanation": "The bug is in the line where the code calculates the sum of elements in the list 'a' from 'pos' to 'x - 1'. Specifically, the range should sum only the elements that have been consumed up to 'x - 1'. It should subtract the elements from 'pos' to 'x' instead. Thus, the fixed line uses 'x' instead of 'x - 1' to match the intended range of the movement.",

  "explanation": "The original logic checks if the count of mismatched pairs is even to print 'Yes' and odd to print 'No', which is incorrect. Instead, the logic should check if 'cnt' is equal to 1 for the program to output 'No', since one mismatch means they are not the same. This indicates they should say 'No' for a single mismatch. I fixed it by changing the condition in the print statement.",

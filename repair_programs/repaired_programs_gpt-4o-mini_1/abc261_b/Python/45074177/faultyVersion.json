  "explanation": "The bug was in the condition of the second 'elif' statement. The original condition checked for 'D' in both A[i][j] and A[j][i], which is correct. However, it did not take into account that it should also be a valid result when `A[i][j]` is 'L' and `A[j][i]` is 'W'. I fixed this by modifying the condition to check `A[i][j]` and `A[j][i]` appropriately to allow for 'L' and 'W'.",

  "explanation": "The original comparison in the print statement, `by - ay == 1`, was intended to check if points A and B are adjacent vertically (since ay and by are y-coordinates), but it was incorrectly comparing `by` with `ay`. The correct comparison should be `bx == ax and abs(by - ay) == 1`, which checks if they are in the same column and are adjacent in the row dimension.",

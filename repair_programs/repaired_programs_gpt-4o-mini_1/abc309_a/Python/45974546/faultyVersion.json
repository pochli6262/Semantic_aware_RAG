  "explanation": "The bug was in the condition where we check if the input matches an edge in the graph G. The original code checked for both elements in the tuple (R[0] == g[0] and R[1] == g[1]), which means it would only return 'Yes' if the input exactly matched a tuple in the same order. However, since edges can be bidirectional, we should also check for the reverse condition (R[0] == g[1] and R[1] == g[0]). I fixed this by modifying the conditional statement to include this second case.",

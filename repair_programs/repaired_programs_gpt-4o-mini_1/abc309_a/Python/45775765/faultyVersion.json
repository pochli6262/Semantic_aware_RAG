  "explanation": "The original code contains multiple conditional checks comparing tuples of two integers (A, B) with specified pairs. The error is that the lower bound (4, 5) and higher bound (5, 6) cases were missing. If the user inputs values that were adjacent but not exactly those given in the conditions, such as (2, 3), it will miss other possible pairs. Therefore, to improve usability while maintaining the same logic with limited options, I would correct the entire structure of checks to maintain the logic intended. However, since we have to change only one line, I will adjust the comparison from 'elif' to 'if' to allow multiple true conditions to trigger.",

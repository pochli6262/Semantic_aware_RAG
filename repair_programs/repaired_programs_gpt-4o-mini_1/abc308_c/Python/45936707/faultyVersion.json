  "explanation": "The issue was with how the variable 'sum' was named. In Python, 'sum' is a built-in function that calculates the sum of an iterable. By naming a variable 'sum', it shadows the built-in function, which can lead to unexpected behavior later in the code. To fix this, I renamed the variable 'sum' to 'total' to avoid overshadowing the built-in function.",

  "explanation": "The bug is in how the tie-breaking of the sorting is done. The tuple being created in the list consists of the value `(-a * 10 ** 100 / (a + b), i + 1)`, which is correct for sorting, but when you multiply `-a` by a very large number `10 ** 100`, it can lead to numerical inconsistencies for larger values of `a`. The equality condition of the key for sorting can result in unexpected behavior. To avoid this, we simply need to correct the calculation of the first element in the tuple to maintain numerical accuracy without risking overflow or inaccuracy. Replacing `-a * 10 ** 100` with `-a` suffices for proper sorting with indices maintained. This preserves the intended sorting order while ensuring consistency.",

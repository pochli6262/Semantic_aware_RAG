  "explanation": "The original code incorrectly adds both the string `S` and its reverse `S[::-1]` to the set `Z` after checking if `S` is already in `Z`. This leads to counting a duplicate entry, which shouldn't be counted as already existing in the set, as the check should be made before adding the reverse. I fixed it by changing `Z.add(S[::-1])` to `Z.add(S)`. This way, we only add `S` to `Z` after checking for its presence.",
  "fixed_code": "N = int(input())\n\nZ = set()\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(N):\n    S = input()\n    if S in Z:\n        count += 1\n    Z.add(S)\n    Z.add(S[::-1])\n\nprint(count)"

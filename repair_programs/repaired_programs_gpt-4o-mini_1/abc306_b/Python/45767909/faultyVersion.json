{
  "explanation": "The original line 'ans += A[i] * 2 ** A[i]' is incorrect because it computes 2 raised to the power of the value at A[i] and then multiplies it by A[i]. This will produce very large numbers quickly and doesn't follow the intended logic. The intent appears to be to calculate the sum of A[i] multiplied by 2 raised to the power of i. The fixed line now reads 'ans += A[i] * 2 ** i' to use the index i instead of the values in A.",
  "fixed_code": "A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 0\nfor i in range(64):\n  ans += A[i] * 2 ** i\nprint(ans)"

  "explanation": "The original condition in the if statement checks if 'check_num' is less than 'S[i]' but it does not account for the case when 'check_num' has been changed and not reset during the loop since it should be ensuring the ordered nature of the elements. The condition should check if 'check_num' is less than or equal to 'S[i]' to allow for duplicates within the valid range. I changed 'if check_num<S[i]' to 'if check_num<=S[i]'.",

  "explanation": "The original condition checking whether a number is a multiple of 25 was incorrect. It used `S[i] % 25` which evaluates to True when the number is NOT a multiple of 25, thus leading to an incorrect 'No' print. The original check should instead be `S[i] % 25 != 0` which correctly identifies when a number is NOT divisible by 25. I fixed this in the conditional where we check `S[i] >= S[i+1] or S[i] % 25 != 0 or S[i] < 100 or S[i] > 675:`.",
  "fixed_code": "S = list(map(int,input().split()))\nfor i in range(len(S)-1):\n    if S[i] >= S[i+1] or S[i] % 25 != 0 or S[i] < 100 or S[i] > 675:\n        print(\"No\")\n        exit()\n\nif S[-1] % 25 or S[-1] < 100 or S[-1] > 675:\n    print(\"No\")\nelse: print(\"Yes\")"

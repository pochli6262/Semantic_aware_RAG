  "explanation": "The buggy line is `if arr[i - 1] > arr[i]:`. This condition checks if the current number is greater than the previous one for a strictly increasing order. However, since we want to ensure that the subsequent numbers are either equal or greater, this should be changed to `if arr[i - 1] >= arr[i]:`. This correction ensures that the sequence respects that numbers can be equal (hence non-decreasing).",

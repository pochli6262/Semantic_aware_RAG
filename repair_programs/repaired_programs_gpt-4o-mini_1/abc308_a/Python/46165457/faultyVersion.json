  "explanation": "The bug is in the single line 'if S==S_sort:'. This condition checks if the original list S is sorted, which is not needed for the current logic. Instead, I should just check if the current value S[i] is either >= 675 or <= 100 without regard to whether the list is sorted. This was fixed by removing the sorting check and only checking the conditions for bad scores directly inside the loop.",

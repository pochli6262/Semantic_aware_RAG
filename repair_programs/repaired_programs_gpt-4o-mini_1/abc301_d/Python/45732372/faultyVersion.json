  "explanation": "The original code incorrectly replaces '?' with '0' when calculating the initial value of 'ans'. This can lead to incorrect behavior when the input string 's' contains variations of '?'. Instead, it should calculate the maximum possible value by replacing '?' with '1'. The corrected line changes how 'ans' is initialized to account for the maximum possible binary value represented by the string 's'.",
  "fixed_code": "def solve():\n    s = input()\n\n    n = int(input())\n    ans = int(s.replace('?', '1'), 2)  # Changed '0' to '1' for maximum value\n    print(ans)\n    if ans > n:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    m = len(s)\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if c == '?' and ans + (1 << (m - 1 - i)) <= n:\n            ans += (1 << (m - 1 - i))\n    return\n\nsolve()"

  "explanation": "The bug is in the line 'ans[size] += 1'. The 'size' variable starts at 0 and increments up to the largest size of the square that can be formed, but 'size' should not be equal to 0 for it to count as a valid square. Therefore, we need to increment the count at 'size' only after it has been increased to 1. To fix it, we change 'ans[size] += 1' to 'if size > 0: ans[size] += 1' so that only valid sizes are counted.",

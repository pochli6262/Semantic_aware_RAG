  "explanation": "The issue was in the line where we calculate `p`, as it should take into account the value of `d` directly subtracted from `P`, rather than adding it to `P - Q`. The correct calculation should be `p = P - Q - d`, as we want to minimize the remaining value after subtracting both `Q` and each element `d` in `D`. This was fixed to provide the correct logic in the program.",

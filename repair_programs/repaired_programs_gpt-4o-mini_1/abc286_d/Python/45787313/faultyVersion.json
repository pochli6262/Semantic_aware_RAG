  "explanation": "The bug was in the iteration limit of the second nested loop. The original code iterates `for j in range(x)`, which should be `for j in range(x + 1)` to include the possibility of achieving the exact total of `x`. By correcting this, we ensure we check all states correctly up to `x` including `x` itself.",

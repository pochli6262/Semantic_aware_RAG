  "explanation": "The variable 'black' is being defined outside the 'solve()' function and is not passed to it as a parameter. To fix this issue, we should pass the 'black' variable to the 'solve()' function instead of using it as a global variable. This is the single line I changed: I added 'black' as a parameter to the 'solve' function.",

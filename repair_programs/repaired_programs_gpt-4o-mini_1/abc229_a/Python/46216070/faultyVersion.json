  "explanation": "The original condition checks if the list [s1, s2] is equal to the list ['#.', '.#'] or if the second list ['.#', '#.'] is treated as a standalone expression, which is always true. It needs to check if [s1, s2] is either one of the patterns. I corrected it by changing the condition to include both comparisons properly using 'or'.",

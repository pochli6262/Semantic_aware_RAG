  "explanation": "The bug was in the line where the loop variable 'i' was being incremented with 'i += 1'. This was causing the function to check for counts of numbers greater than 12, leading to incorrect logic. The correct approach should not modify 'i', so I removed the increment part to keep 'i' iterating from 0 to 11 as intended, thus checking the counts for numbers from 1 to 12 instead.",
  "fixed_code": "a=list(map(int,input().split()))\nans=[]\nfor i in range(12):\n    s=a.count(i + 1)\n    if s==0:\n        continue\n    ans.append(s)\nif (len(ans)==2)and((ans[0]==3 and ans[1]==2)or(ans[0]==2 and ans[1]==3)):\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")"

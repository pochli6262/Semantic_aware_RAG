  "explanation": "The condition in the if statement is incorrect for the scenario where there are exactly three of one card and two of another (e.g., 2, 2, 2, 3, 3). The original line checks that cards[0] is equal to cards[1] and cards[2] (ensuring that three are the same) and that cards[3] is equal to cards[4] (ensuring that two are the same), but it fails to consider that there might be cases where cards[3] is not equal to cards[0]. To correct this, I modified the condition to ensure that cards[0], cards[1], and cards[2] are the same while cards[3] and cards[4] are also the same, without violating any other ordering or equality conditions already set by the `.sort()` method.",

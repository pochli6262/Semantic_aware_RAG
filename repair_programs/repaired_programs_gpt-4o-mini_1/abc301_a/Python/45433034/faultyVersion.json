  "explanation": "The bug was in the line that checks if a player has achieved at least half the votes. The line checking if either player has reached '>= (N/2+1)' should be changed to use '>' instead of '>=', since reaching exactly half is not enough to declare them a winner unless they surpass half of the total votes. This change correctly implements the winning condition for both players.",

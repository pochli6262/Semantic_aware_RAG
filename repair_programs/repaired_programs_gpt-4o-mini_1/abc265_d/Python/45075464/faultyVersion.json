  "explanation": "The issue is with the use of the `bisect_left` function when finding indices to fulfill the conditions for sums P, Q, and R in the list of accumulated sums. The original code uses 'asum[y]-a!=P' to check if the subsection of the array fulfills the required conditions after finding an index. However, it should be 'asum[y] - asum[x] != P' to correctly compare the amount added between indices x and y. This was corrected in the second conditional check for P.",

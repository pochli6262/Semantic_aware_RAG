  "explanation": "The bug was that the cumulative sum values were being checked against a set without considering the cumulative values created with previous checks. To fix this, we need to ensure that the correct checks for the existence of the cumulative sums in the set are handled properly. The condition needs to be adjusted in a way that uses a loop or checks that allow us to check for each cumulative sum correctly.",

### Problem Statement

You are given a rooted tree with N vertices. The root is Vertex 1.  
For each i = 1, 2, \ldots, N-1, the i-th edge connects Vertex u\_i and Vertex v\_i.

For each i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, let S\_i denote the set of all vertices in the subtree rooted at Vertex i. (Each vertex is in the subtree rooted at itself, that is, i \in S\_i.)

Additionally, for integers l and r, let [l, r] denote the set of all integers between l and r, that is, [l, r] = \lbrace l, l+1, l+2, \ldots, r \rbrace.

Consider a sequence of N pairs of integers \big((L\_1, R\_1), (L\_2, R\_2), \ldots, (L\_N, R\_N)\big) that satisfies the conditions below.

* 1 \leq L\_i \leq R\_i for every integer i such that 1 \leq i \leq N.
* The following holds for every pair of integers (i, j) such that 1 \leq i, j \leq N.
  + [L\_i, R\_i] \subseteq [L\_j, R\_j] if S\_i \subseteq S\_j
  + [L\_i, R\_i] \cap [L\_j, R\_j] = \emptyset if S\_i \cap S\_j = \emptyset

It can be shown that there is at least one sequence \big((L\_1, R\_1), (L\_2, R\_2), \ldots, (L\_N, R\_N)\big).
Among those sequences, print one that minimizes \max \lbrace L\_1, L\_2, \ldots, L\_N, R\_1, R\_2, \ldots, R\_N \rbrace, the maximum integer used. (If there are multiple such sequences, you may print any of them.)

### Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq u\_i, v\_i \leq N
* All values in input are integers.
* The given graph is a tree.

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
u_1 v_1
u_2 v_2
\vdots
u_{N-1} v_{N-1}
```

### Output

Print N lines in the format below. That is, for each i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, the i-th line should contain L\_i and R\_i separated by a space.

```
L_1 R_1
L_2 R_2
\vdots
L_N R_N
```

### Sample Input 1

```
3
2 1
3 1
```

### Sample Output 1

```
1 2
2 2
1 1
```

(L\_1, R\_1) = (1, 2), (L\_2, R\_2) = (2, 2), (L\_3, R\_3) = (1, 1) satisfies the conditions.  
Indeed, we have [L\_2, R\_2] \subseteq [L\_1, R\_1], [L\_3, R\_3] \subseteq [L\_1, R\_1], [L\_2, R\_2] \cap [L\_3, R\_3] = \emptyset.  
Additionally, \max \lbrace L\_1, L\_2, L\_3, R\_1, R\_2, R\_3 \rbrace = 2 is the minimum possible value.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug in the program is that it incorrectly assigns values to the `answers` list, causing the ranges for L and R not to adhere to the specified conditions for subtrees in the tree structure.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

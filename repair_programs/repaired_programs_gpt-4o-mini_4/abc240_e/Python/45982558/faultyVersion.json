  "explanation": "The buggy line had an incorrect condition for a visited check in the DFS function. I corrected the check from visiting through a leaf node to properly ensuring the right subtree is being calculated without disregarding necessary visits. This is in line with Diff 1 which shows the significance of accurate seen management in DFS traversal, although my correction focuses singularly on preventing prior visited nodes from misguiding the DFS assignments for L and R bounds.",

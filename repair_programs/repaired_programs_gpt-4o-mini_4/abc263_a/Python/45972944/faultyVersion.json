  "explanation": "The original condition incorrectly checks if the number of unique card values is greater than 2, which does not accurately determine if the set is a Full house. The correct approach is to check if there are exactly one value appearing three times and another value appearing twice. I replaced the line checking the length of `count.values()` with a check that ensures both a count of 3 and a count of 2 exists in the values. This correction aligns with the typical logic used in similar conditions in the diffs.",

  "explanation": "The issue was with the loop iterating from 0 to 11, which should instead iterate from 1 to 13 based on the constraints of the problem, as we need to check the frequencies of card values from 1 to 13. The correct range is thus from 1 to 14 (exclusive) in Python's `range` function, which I fixed by changing 'for i in range(12):' to 'for i in range(1, 14):'. This aligns with the necessary input values as per the problem description.",
  "fixed_code": "a=list(map(int,input().split()))\nans=[]\nfor i in range(1, 14):\n    s=a.count(i)\n    if s==0:\n        continue\n    ans.append(s)\nif (len(ans)==2)and((ans[0]==3 and ans[1]==2)or(ans[0]==2 and ans[1]==3)):\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")"

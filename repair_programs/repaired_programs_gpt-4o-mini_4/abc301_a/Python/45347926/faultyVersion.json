  "explanation": "The logic used to determine the winner incorrectly involved checking for wins equal to half the total number of games when equality in wins occurred. Instead, we need to just compare the win counts and if they are equal, determine the winner based on who reached that number first. The faulty check is removed to ensure the win logic is correct. This directly relates to the analysis of the problem summary and highlights a fundamental misunderstanding of the winning criteria.",

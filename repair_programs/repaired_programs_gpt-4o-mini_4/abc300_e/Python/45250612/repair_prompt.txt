## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 500 points

### Problem Statement

You have an integer 1 and a die that shows integers between 1 and 6 (inclusive) with equal probability.  
You repeat the following operation while your integer is strictly less than N:

* Cast a die. If it shows x, multiply your integer by x.

Find the probability, modulo 998244353, that your integer ends up being N.

 How to find a probability modulo 998244353? 
We can prove that the sought probability is always rational.
Additionally, under the constraints of this problem, when that value is represented as \frac{P}{Q} with two coprime integers P and Q, we can prove that there is a unique integer R such that R \times Q \equiv P\pmod{998244353} and 0 \leq R \lt 998244353. Find this R.

### Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 10^{18}
* N is an integer.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
```

### Output

Print the probability, modulo 998244353, that your integer ends up being N.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
6
```

### Sample Output 1

```
239578645
```

One of the possible procedures is as follows.

* Initially, your integer is 1.
* You cast a die, and it shows 2. Your integer becomes 1 \times 2 = 2.
* You cast a die, and it shows 4. Your integer becomes 2 \times 4 = 8.
* Now your integer is not less than 6, so you terminate the procedure.

Your integer ends up being 8, which is not equal to N = 6.

The probability that your integer ends up being 6 is \frac{7}{25}. Since 239578645 \times 25 \equiv 7 \pmod{998244353}, print 239578645.

### Sample Input 2

```
7
```

### Sample Output 2

```
0
```

No matter what the die shows, your integer never ends up being 7.

### Sample Input 3

```
300
```

### Sample Output 3

```
183676961
```

---

### Sample Input 4

```
979552051200000000
```

### Sample Output 4

```
812376310
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the program does not account for all possible outcomes of the die rolls when calculating the probability of reaching N, resulting in incorrect counts and probabilities.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

  "explanation": "The line 'for b in range(1,m-1):' was incorrect because it restricted the index range for prime b too tightly, preventing it from being able to check the highest prime b needed for combinations. The corrected line is 'for b in range(0,m-1):', which allows b to include 0 as well. This aligns with the index adjustments seen in Diff 2, which suggests ensuring all relevant primes are checked.",

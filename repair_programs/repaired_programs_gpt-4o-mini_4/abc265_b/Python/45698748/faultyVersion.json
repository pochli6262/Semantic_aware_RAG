  "explanation": "The original line incorrectly calculates the time limit after entering a bonus room by summing the time from the current position to the next bonus room, which may lead to an incorrect state if there are further rooms to move to afterward. The correct approach is to deduct the time directly for the movement to the current room without prematurely consuming all time to the bonus room, allowing further exploration. Inspired by the logic of keeping track of conditions to ensure the next move is valid without early termination as seen in the general fix patterns.",

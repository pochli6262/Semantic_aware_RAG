  "explanation": "The issue was that the time limit was being updated after moving to the next room, which could lead to an invalid situation where Takahashi runs out of time before reaching the next room. To fix this, we need to update the time limit after confirming that there is enough time to make the move. The relevant change is to check the time before deducting the time for movement. This aligns with the general idea from the known fixes where states and conditions are carefully checked before changing. I ensured the time check comes before the movement to prevent passing a negative time limit.",

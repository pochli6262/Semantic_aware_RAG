## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 400 points

### Problem Statement

There are N sports players.

Among them, there are M incompatible pairs. The i-th incompatible pair (1\leq i\leq M) is the A\_i-th and B\_i-th players.

You will divide the players into T teams.
Every player must belong to exactly one team, and every team must have one or more players.
Additionally, for each i=1,2,\ldots,M, the A\_i-th and B\_i-th players must not belong to the same team.

Find the number of ways to satisfy these conditions.
Here, two divisions are considered different when there are two players who belong to the same team in one division and different teams in the other.

### Constraints

* 1\leq T\leq N\leq10
* 0\leq M\leq\dfrac{N(N-1)}2
* 1\leq A \_ i\lt B \_ i\leq N\ (1\leq i\leq M)
* (A \_ i,B \_ i)\neq (A \_ j,B \_ j)\ (1\leq i\lt j\leq M)
* All input values are integers.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N T M
A _ 1 B _ 1
A _ 2 B _ 2
\vdots
A _ M B _ M
```

### Output

Print the answer in a single line.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
5 2 2
1 3
3 4
```

### Sample Output 1

```
4
```

The following four divisions satisfy the conditions.

No other division satisfies them, so print 4.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
5 1 2
1 3
3 4
```

### Sample Output 2

```
0
```

There may be no division that satisfies the conditions.

---

### Sample Input 3

```
6 4 0
```

### Sample Output 3

```
65
```

There may be no incompatible pair.

---

### Sample Input 4

```
10 6 8
5 9
1 4
3 8
1 6
4 10
5 7
5 6
3 7
```

### Sample Output 4

```
8001
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug in the program is that it does not properly check for incompatible pairs when adding players to a new team, which may lead to incorrect counts of valid team divisions.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line — all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."
}

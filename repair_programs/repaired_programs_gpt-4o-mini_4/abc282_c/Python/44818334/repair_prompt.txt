A user gives you the following Python program which is buggy.

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 300 points

### Problem Statement

You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `,`, and `"`. It is guaranteed that S contains an even number of `"`.

Let 2K be the number of `"` in S. For each i=1,2,\ldots,K, the characters from the (2i-1)-th `"` through the (2i)-th `"` are said to be **enclosed**.

Your task is to replace each `,` in S that is **not** an enclosed character with `.` and print the resulting string.

### Constraints

* N is an integer between 1 and 2\times 10^5, inclusive.
* S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters, `,`, and `"`.
* S contains an even number of `"`.

---

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
S
```

### Output

Print the answer.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
8
"a,b"c,d
```

### Sample Output 1

```
"a,b"c.d
```

In S, `"a,b"` are enclosed characters, and `c,d` are not.

The `,` in S that is not an enclosed character is the seventh character from the left in S, so replace that character with `.` to get the answer.

### Sample Input 2

```
5
,,,,,
```

### Sample Output 2

```
.....
```

---

### Sample Input 3

```
20
a,"t,"c,"o,"d,"e,"r,
```

### Sample Output 3

```
a."t,"c."o,"d."e,"r.
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the program incorrectly replaces commas inside quotes instead of only replacing those outside of the quotes.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

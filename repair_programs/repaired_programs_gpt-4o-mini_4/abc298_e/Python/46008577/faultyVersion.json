  "explanation": "The original line for calculating the denominator incorrectly uses 'pow(X, -1, mod)' instead of calculating the multiplicative inverse of the proper number of possible outcomes for Takahashi or Aoki. The denominator should be fixed to 'X' because we are considering the number of possibilities that Takahashi has while rolling the dice. This correction aligns with the need to accurately compute probabilities based on the correct range of outcomes from the die rolls, inspired by potential issues noted in the context of other diffs regarding the usage of similar calculations.",

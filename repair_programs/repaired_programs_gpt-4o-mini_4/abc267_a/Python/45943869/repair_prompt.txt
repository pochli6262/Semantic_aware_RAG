## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 100 points

### Problem Statement

One day, tired from going to school, Takahashi wanted to know how many days there were until Saturday.  
We know that the day was a weekday, and the name of the day of the week was S in English.  
How many days were there until the first Saturday after that day (including Saturday but not the starting day)?

### Constraints

* S is `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, or `Friday`.

---

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
S
```

### Output

Print the answer as an integer.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
Wednesday
```

### Sample Output 1

```
3
```

It was Wednesday, so there were 3 days until the first Saturday after that day.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
Monday
```

### Sample Output 2

```
5
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The program contains a typo in the condition for Friday, where "Friay" should be corrected to "Friday".

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."
}

  "explanation": "The original line conditionally determines the nearest water station based on whether `n % 5 >= 2`, which fails when `n` is exactly at a water station (e.g., multiples of 5). Instead, it should account for those cases by rounding to the nearest station correctly. I corrected it to always check the floor division and the increment for both the upper and lower nearest stations. This is related to the idea of making adjustments based on known patterns in other diffs, particularly `Diff 1` where conditions for adjustments are more definitive.",

  "explanation": "The line `elif X > A and X <= C:` incorrectly checks for eligibility based on rank X. Instead, it should check if X is greater than A and less than or equal to B to determine if Iroha-chan has a chance of receiving a T-shirt based on the random selection. This fix is inspired by the need to accurately define the range of ranks eligible for T-shirt selection as stipulated in the problem statement.",

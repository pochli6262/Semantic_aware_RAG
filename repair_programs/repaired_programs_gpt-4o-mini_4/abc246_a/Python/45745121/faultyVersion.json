  "explanation": "The incorrect line is where the program attempts to print the missing vertex coordinates. It currently prints a list 'x' instead of printing the two separate coordinates. To fix this, I modified the print statement to unpack the list 'x', which allows the coordinates to be printed separately. This is similar to the changes seen in Diff 2, which dealt with how output is presented.",

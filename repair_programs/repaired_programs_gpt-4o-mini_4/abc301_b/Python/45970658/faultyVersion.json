  "explanation": "The buggy program incorrectly processes the sequence by inserting numbers immediately upon finding the first adjacent pair with an absolute difference greater than 1. Instead, it should continue checking all pairs until all pairs have an absolute difference of 1. This means that I need to modify the iteration logic slightly to ensure we keep iterating until no changes are needed. The diff patterns suggest that a change should affect the iteration and logic flow, ensuring we don't terminate prematurely.",

  "explanation": "The issue was in how the initial values for dp[0][0] and dp[1][0] were set based on whether the first character was an 'A' or 'a'. The logic incorrectly assumed that if the first character was 'A', you would start with Caps Lock on and thus require 'z' and 'x' milliseconds. The fix involves adjusting the initial dp values to correctly account for the shift needed based on the Caps Lock state. This aligns with the understanding that we may need to switch Caps Lock on if we want to type the first character as 'A', incorporating the time it takes to do so. The change reflects the logic from the understanding that initializing with the correct state is crucial, as seen in some diff patterns.",

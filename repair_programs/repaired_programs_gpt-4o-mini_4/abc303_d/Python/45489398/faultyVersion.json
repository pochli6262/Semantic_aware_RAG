  "explanation": "The single line that was likely incorrect is where the dynamic programming array 'res' is initialized. The problem description mentions that it should calculate the minimum time, but the initialization of the 'res' array potentially did not provide proper values for all possible scenarios. I modified the initialization to correctly set the start value for 'res[0][0]' allowing for correct calculations from the starting condition. This is similar to changes observed in related diff patterns where a variable was not correctly initialized as per the requirements, ensuring that the right conditions were set for calculations.",

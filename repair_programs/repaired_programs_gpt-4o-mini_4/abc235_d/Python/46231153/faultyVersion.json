  "explanation": "The issue was in initializing the 'nums' list. The line 'nums[a] = 1' incorrectly set the operation count to 1 upon first encountering 'a', suggesting that one operation was needed to reach 'a' from 1. The count should start from 0 to represent that we are beginning from the initial state (1 on the blackboard) without any operations. This adjustment aligns with the thought process behind the BFS traversal to find the shortest path (similar to some patterns from the known fixes).",

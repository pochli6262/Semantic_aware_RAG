  "explanation": "The issue was with the initialization of the `numSet` array. The original line created an array of size `10**7` but initialized it with `10**5` for all entries, which is incorrect. It should be initialized with a size that can accommodate all possible states, so I corrected it to have `10**6` entries initialized to a placeholder, ensuring the bounds and operations on the number are managed properly. This fix aligns with the intent to limit the state space to the defined problem constraints. The removal of the multiplication factor in the range for the `numSet` initialization was inspired by the known pattern adjustments in `Diff 1` where range limits are crucial.",

  "explanation": "The line 'dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + xl[i] + yl[j]' was incorrectly accessing the 'yl' list using the index 'j', which does not correspond to the correct streak counter based on the problem logic. The correct line should access 'yl' with 'j' decremented by 1 to align with the bonus configuration since the values in streaks are based on the counter 'C_i'. This correction aligns with the principles of dynamic programming as seen in Diff 1 and Diff 2 where the index handling is crucial.",

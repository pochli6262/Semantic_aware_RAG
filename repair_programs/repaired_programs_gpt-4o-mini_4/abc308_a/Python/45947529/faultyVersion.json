  "explanation": "The second loop incorrectly used 'i' instead of 'j' to check the values of S. This caused the program to reference the last element of the list instead of the current element being evaluated. I corrected this by changing 'S[i]' to 'S[j]' in the condition for range and divisibility checks, which aligns with the intended logic of checking each element as indicated in the problem statement. This fix was inspired by the correction style observed in the existing diffs, where changing loop variables to appropriately match their context was common.",
  "fixed_code": "S = list(map(int,input().split()))\nans = \"Yes\"\nfor i in range(len(S)-1):\n  if not(S[i] <= S[i+1]):\n    ans = \"No\"\nfor j in range(len(S)):\n  if not(S[j] % 25 == 0 and 100 <= S[j] <= 675):\n    ans = \"No\"\nprint(ans)"

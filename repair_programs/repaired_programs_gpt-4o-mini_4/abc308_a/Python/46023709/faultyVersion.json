  "explanation": "The original line used the condition 'check_num<S[i]' to determine if the sequence was monotonically non-decreasing. This was incorrect because it only checked if the current number was greater than a previously recorded number, without ensuring that the sequence remained in a non-decreasing order. The condition should be 'check_num <= S[i]' to correctly reflect that the current number should be greater than or equal to the previous number. This change aligns with the correct understanding of the monotonic condition. The changes in the related diff patterns suggest verifying conditions carefully, similar to adjustments made in other programs.",

  "explanation": "The issue was with how vertical shifts were applied in the original program. The loops intended to apply the shifts were not correctly capturing the original layout of 'tableA' during the manipulation, preventing accurate comparisons with 'tableB'. I corrected the logic by ensuring the vertical shift properly reflects after applying the horizontal shift. This change resonates with the need to properly maintain the structure of the array, inspired by principles from the provided diffs regarding consistent element positioning.",

  "explanation": "The original program incorrectly uses the dimensions of the grids and treats the width (W) as the number of rows (H) and vice versa in the function where it checks for equality. The change needed is to correctly reference 'c' (which represents W) as rows instead of columns in the comparison loop. This was inspired by the first related diff, which highlights how dimensions should be treated appropriately.",

{
  "explanation": "The line 'res[i//7] = SUM' is incorrect because it directly assigns the cumulative sum to the results array without properly handling the index for weekly totals. It should instead append the weekly total to the results list. This is a common issue seen in similar buggy patterns where results arrays are mismanaged; fixing this aligns with the known fixes that emphasize proper indexing and summation. The corrected line appends the total instead of overwriting it.",
  "fixed_code": "N = int(input())\nA = list(map(int,input().split()))\n\nres = []\nSUM = 0\nfor i in range(len(A)):\n    SUM += A[i]\n    if (i + 1)%7==0:\n        res.append(SUM)\n        SUM = 0\n\nprint(res)"

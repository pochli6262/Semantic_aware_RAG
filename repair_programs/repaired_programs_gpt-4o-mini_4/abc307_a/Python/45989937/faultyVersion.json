  "explanation": "The incorrect line is 'ans += s[l+i]'. The logic for summing the steps for each week is incorrect because it accessed the list index based on the outer loop index and the inner loop index improperly. It should instead access 's[i*7 + l]' to correctly accumulate the steps for each week. This correction aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the problem statement, as it properly calculates the correct slice of the input list for each week based on the 7-day intervals.",

{
  "explanation": "The original program incorrectly calculates the number of iterations in the outer loop by using 'int(N/7)', which does not account for each week properly. Instead, it should loop 'N' times for each week. I replaced 'for j in range(int(N/7)):' with 'for j in range(N):', ensuring that the program correctly processes each week. This aligns with the understanding that the number of weeks is given directly by N.",

  "explanation": "The bug in the program occurs because it does not handle the case where N is exactly 10^9 - 1, which falls outside of the defined ranges for truncation. To fix this, I added an additional condition to the last 'elif' statement to explicitly handle when N is equal to 10^9 - 1. This is inspired by the structure indicated in the known fixes, where proper range checking and inclusive boundaries are important.",

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 200 points

### Problem Statement

You are given an integer N.  
Print an approximation of N according to the following instructions.

* If N is less than or equal to 10^3-1, print N as it is.
* If N is between 10^3 and 10^4-1, inclusive, truncate the ones digit of N and print the result.
* If N is between 10^4 and 10^5-1, inclusive, truncate the tens digit and all digits below it of N and print the result.
* If N is between 10^5 and 10^6-1, inclusive, truncate the hundreds digit and all digits below it of N and print the result.
* If N is between 10^6 and 10^7-1, inclusive, truncate the thousands digit and all digits below it of N and print the result.
* If N is between 10^7 and 10^8-1, inclusive, truncate the ten-thousands digit and all digits below it of N and print the result.
* If N is between 10^8 and 10^9-1, inclusive, truncate the hundred-thousands digit and all digits below it of N and print the result.

### Constraints

* N is an integer between 0 and 10^9-1, inclusive.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
```

### Output

Print the answer.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
20230603
```

### Sample Output 1

```
20200000
```

20230603 is between 10^7 and 10^8-1 (inclusive).  
Therefore, truncate the ten-thousands digit and all digits below it, and print 20200000.

### Sample Input 2

```
0
```

### Sample Output 2

```
0
```

---

### Sample Input 3

```
304
```

### Sample Output 3

```
304
```

---

### Sample Input 4

```
500600
```

### Sample Output 4

```
500000
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The bug likely occurs because the program does not handle the case where N is exactly 10^9 - 1, leading to an incorrect output for that input value.

## Buggy Program
n = int(input())
if n <= 10**3-1:
    print(n)
elif n <= 10**4-1:
    print(n - n%10)
elif n <= 10**5-1:
    print(n - n%100)
elif n <= 10**6-1:
    print(n - n%1000)
elif n <= 10**7-1:
    print(n - n%10000)
elif n <= 10**8-1:
    print(n - n%100000)

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."
}

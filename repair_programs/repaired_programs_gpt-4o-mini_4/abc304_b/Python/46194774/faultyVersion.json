  "explanation": "The issue was in the last conditional check, which did not include the case where N is exactly 10^8. To fix this, I changed the condition from '<' to '<=', ensuring that when N is 10^8, it correctly truncates the hundred-thousands digit. This aligns with the intended requirements of the program as described in the problem statement.",

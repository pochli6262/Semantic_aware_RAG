  "explanation": "The issue in the original program was the use of the name 'range' for the function, which shadows the built-in `range` function and causes unexpected behavior. This function name should be changed to avoid overwriting the built-in functionality. Inspired by the known fixes, I corrected the function name to avoid conflicts, allowing the code to operate as intended.",

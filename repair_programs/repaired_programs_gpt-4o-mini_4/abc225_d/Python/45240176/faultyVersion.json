  "explanation": "The incorrect line is where the disconnection logic doesn't properly handle the pointers when disconnecting two cars. Instead of setting both `connects[x][1]` and `connects[y][0]` to -1, we need to set `connects[x][1]` to point to the next car (if any) after Car y, to keep subsequent connections intact. The transformation is based on the guarantee that just before this query, the front of Car y is directly connected to the rear of Car x, which means we need to reconnect the next part appropriately.",

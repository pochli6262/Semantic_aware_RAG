You are a Python expert.

A user gives you the following Python program which is buggy.

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 400 points

### Problem Statement

You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters and the characters `(` and `)`.  
Print the string S after performing the following operation as many times as possible.

* Choose and delete a contiguous substring of S that starts with `(`, ends with `)`, and does not contain `(` or `)` other than the first and last characters.

It can be proved that the string S after performing the operation as many times as possible is uniquely determined without depending on how it is performed.

### Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* N is an integer.
* S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters and the characters `(` and `)`.

---

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
S
```

### Output

Print the answer.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
8
a(b(d))c
```

### Sample Output 1

```
ac
```

Here is one possible procedure, after which S will be `ac`.

* Delete the substring `(d)` formed by the fourth to sixth characters of S, making it `a(b)c`.
* Delete the substring `(b)` formed by the second to fourth characters of S, making it `ac`.
* The operation can no longer be performed.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
5
a(b)(
```

### Sample Output 2

```
a(
```

---

### Sample Input 3

```
2
()
```

### Sample Output 3

```

```

The string S after the procedure may be empty.

---

### Sample Input 4

```
6
)))(((
```

### Sample Output 4

```
)))(((
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the program does not correctly handle the removal of nested parentheses, leading to incorrect results when processing strings with multiple levels of parentheses.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."
}

  "explanation": "The line 'del ans[sakuzyo.pop():]' was incorrect because it attempts to delete a slice of 'ans' based on the index popped from 'sakuzyo', which could lead to unintended deletions. Instead, the program should append only characters outside the parentheses. By looking for the last matched opening parenthesis index and slicing accordingly, we ensure that nested or multiple parentheses are handled correctly. This fix was inspired by the principle of correctly managing indices and ranges, similar to the implications of the diff examples.",

  "explanation": "The logic used to determine contradictions was incorrect; it counted `correct` cases instead of verifying them. Specifically, the conditions that checked for contradictions were flawed, and I needed to ensure that if Player i beats Player j, then Player j must lose to Player i (and similarly for the other match outcomes). For fixing this, I referenced similar patterns from the provided diffs that corrected logical conditions. The updated line ensures that contradictory match results are identified correctly.",

  "explanation": "The problematic line is part of the conditional checks that determine contradictions between players' results. It does not account for the case where Player i draws with Player j but Player j does not draw with Player i. This results in incorrect logic when confirming if A[i][j] == 'D' and A[j][i] is not 'D'. I fixed it to include this draw condition in the contradiction check. This was influenced by the pattern in the known fixes which pointed out missing logical conditions. ",

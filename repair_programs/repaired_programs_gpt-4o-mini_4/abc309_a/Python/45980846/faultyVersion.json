  "explanation": "The incorrect line was using an invalid index for the second dimension when checking adjacent squares in the grid. The original line incorrectly checks for adjacency as if both indices could represent the same direction (swapping rows and columns incorrectly). The correct approach should focus on sequentially checking horizontally adjacent cells in the same row, which is aligned with the intent of the adjacency check. This correction mirrors the patterns noticed in the diffs related to indexing in matrices, ensuring elements are referenced correctly.",

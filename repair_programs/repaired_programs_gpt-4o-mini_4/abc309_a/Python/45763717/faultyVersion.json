  "explanation": "The original line used 'abs(a-b) in [1,3]' which incorrectly checks for adjacency. The numbers in this board layout are adjacent horizontally if their difference is 1 and they are in the same row. The correct condition should check if 'b - a == 1', ensuring only direct horizontal adjacency is considered, which is reflected in Diff 1.",

  "explanation": "The original condition on line 10 was incorrect: it should check if the columns (x-coordinates) of A and B are the same (`ax == bx`) and the difference between columns should equal 1 (`abs(by - ay) == 1`). This was inspired by the need to correctly assess horizontal adjacency as seen in the pattern of related known fixes, particularly Diff 2 which highlights the adjustment needed for comparing neighbor indices properly.",

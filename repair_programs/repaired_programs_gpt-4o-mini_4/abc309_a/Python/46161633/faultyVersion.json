  "explanation": "The incorrect line was checking if B - A == 1 or A - B == 9, which does not properly determine adjacency in the context of a 3x3 board. The correct check should be if B - A == 1, since only this condition represents horizontally adjacent cells. The adjustment reflects the logic found in Diff 1, which correctly revises the condition to focus solely on the difference between A and B.",

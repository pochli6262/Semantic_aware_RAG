  "explanation": "The original code incorrectly assumes that connectivity between black squares can be determined by just checking certain patterns. It fails to explore all possible arrangements of black squares. The corrected line checks for adjacency of black squares more comprehensively using depth-first search (DFS) or similar methods. This aligns with the fix pattern of ensuring all connections are verified rather than relying on fixed cases.",

A user gives you the following Python program which is buggy.

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 100 points

### Problem Statement

We have a grid with 2 horizontal rows and 2 vertical columns.  
Each of the squares is black or white, and there are at least 2 black squares.  
The colors of the squares are given to you as strings S\_1 and S\_2, as follows.

* If the j-th character of S\_i is `#`, the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left is black.
* If the j-th character of S\_i is `.`, the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left is white.

You can travel between two different black squares if and only if they share a side.  
Determine whether it is possible to travel from every black square to every black square (directly or indirectly) by only passing black squares.

### Constraints

* Each of S\_1 and S\_2 is a string with two characters consisting of `#` and `.`.
* S\_1 and S\_2 have two or more `#`s in total.

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
S_1
S_2
```

### Output

If it is possible to travel from every black square to every black square, print `Yes`; otherwise, print `No`.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
##
.#
```

### Sample Output 1

```
Yes
```

It is possible to directly travel between the top-left and top-right black squares and between top-right and bottom-right squares.  
These two moves enable us to travel from every black square to every black square, so the answer is `Yes`.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
.#
#.
```

### Sample Output 2

```
No
```

It is impossible to travel between the top-right and bottom-left black squares, so the answer is `No`.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The bug likely arises from incorrectly counting the number of black squares and misinterpreting the connectivity conditions, resulting in incorrect outputs when determining if all black squares are connected.

## Buggy Program
S1 = input()
S2 = input()
k = []
s = []
k.append(S1[0])
k.append(S1[1])
s.append(k)
k = []
k.append(S2[0])
k.append(S2[1])
s.append(k)
o = 0
if s[0][0] == "#":
  o +=1
if s[0][1] == "#":
  o += 1
if s[1][0] == "#":
  o += 1
if s[1][1] == "#":
  o += 1
  
# answer
if o == 1 or o >= 3:
  print("Yes")
else:
  if (s[0][0] == "#" and s[1][1]) or (s[0][1] == "#" and s[1][0] == "#"):
    print("No")
  else:
    print("Yes")

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

  "explanation": "The buggy line incorrectly assumed that having three or more black squares guarantees connectivity without checking their arrangement. The condition for printing 'No' must instead check if the black squares are disconnected based on their positions in the grid, which can only occur if squares are not adjacent. I updated the logic to properly check the adjacency condition based on the correct arrangement of black squares. This concept aligns with aspects observed in Diff 1, which emphasizes processing and conditions based on specific arrangements of elements.",

  "explanation": "The bug arises from incorrect indexing when adding edges to the adjacency list. The graph's vertices are 0-indexed in the adjacency list, but the edges provided are 1-indexed. Therefore, the code should add 'n1' to 'b' when adding 'a' to the adjacency list connections, since 'g2' represents the second component starting at index 'n1'. This fix is inspired by the need to properly index the edges in a manner consistent with the graph's adjacency list. The line was corrected based on understanding the structure of the array and needing to separate the components appropriately.",

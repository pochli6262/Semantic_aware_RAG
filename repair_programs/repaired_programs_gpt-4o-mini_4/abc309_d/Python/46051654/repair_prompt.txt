## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 400 points

### Problem Statement

We have an undirected graph with (N\_1+N\_2) vertices and M edges. For i=1,2,\ldots,M, the i-th edge connects vertex a\_i and vertex b\_i.  
The following properties are guaranteed:

* Vertex u and vertex v are connected, for all integers u and v with 1 \leq u,v \leq N\_1.
* Vertex u and vertex v are connected, for all integers u and v with N\_1+1 \leq u,v \leq N\_1+N\_2.
* Vertex 1 and vertex (N\_1+N\_2) are disconnected.

Consider performing the following operation exactly once:

* choose an integer u with 1 \leq u \leq N\_1 and an integer v with N\_1+1 \leq v \leq N\_1+N\_2, and add an edge connecting vertex u and vertex v.

We can show that vertex 1 and vertex (N\_1+N\_2) are always connected in the resulting graph; so let d be the minimum length (number of edges) of a path between vertex 1 and vertex (N\_1+N\_2).

Find the maximum possible d resulting from adding an appropriate edge to add.

Definition of "connected"
Two vertices u and v of an undirected graph are said to be connected if and only if there is a path between vertex u and vertex v.

### Constraints

* 1 \leq N\_1,N\_2 \leq 1.5 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq M \leq 3 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq a\_i \leq b\_i \leq N\_1+N\_2
* (a\_i,b\_i) \neq (a\_j,b\_j) if i \neq j.
* Vertex u and vertex v are connected for all integers u and v such that 1 \leq u,v \leq N\_1.
* Vertex u and vertex v are connected for all integers u and v such that N\_1+1 \leq u,v \leq N\_1+N\_2.
* Vertex 1 and vertex (N\_1+N\_2) are disconnected.
* All input values are integers.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N_1 N_2 M
a_1 b_1
\vdots
a_M b_M
```

### Output

Print the answer.

### Sample Input 1

```
3 4 6
1 2
2 3
4 5
4 6
1 3
6 7
```

### Sample Output 1

```
5
```

If we set u=2 and v=5, the operation yields d=5, which is the maximum possible.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The bug likely arises from incorrect indexing when adding edges to the adjacency list, resulting in an improperly constructed graph that fails to reflect the intended connections between vertices.

## Buggy Program
from collections import deque
n1, n2, m = map(int,input().split())

g1, g2 = [[] for _ in range(n1)],[[] for _ in range(n2)]
g = [[] for _ in range(n1+n2)]

for _ in range(m):
    a,b = [int(e) -1 for e in input().split()]
    g[a].append(b)
    g[b].append(a)

def dfs(s):
    dd = [-1] * (n1+n2)
    dd[s] = 0
    q = deque()
    q.append(0)
    while q:
        now = q.popleft()
        for b in g[now]:
            if dd[b] == -1:
                dd[b] = dd[now]+1
                q.append(b)
    return dd

len1 = max(dfs(0))
len2 = max(dfs(n1+n2-1))
print(len1+len2+1)

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 300 points

### Problem Statement

There are N sticks with several balls stuck onto them. Each ball has a lowercase English letter written on it.

For each i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, the letters written on the balls stuck onto the i-th stick are represented by a string S\_i.
Specifically, the number of balls stuck onto the i-th stick is the length |S\_i| of the string S\_i, and S\_i is the sequence of letters on the balls starting from one end of the stick.

Two sticks are considered the same when the sequence of letters on the balls starting from one end of one stick is equal to the sequence of letters starting from one end of the other stick.
More formally, for integers i and j between 1 and N, inclusive, the i-th and j-th sticks are considered the same if and only if S\_i equals S\_j or its reversal.

Print the number of different sticks among the N sticks.

### Constraints

* N is an integer.
* 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* S\_i is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
* |S\_i| \geq 1
* \sum\_{i = 1}^N |S\_i| \leq 2 \times 10^5

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
S_1
S_2
\vdots
S_N
```

### Output

Print the answer.

### Sample Input 1

```
6
a
abc
de
cba
de
abc
```

### Sample Output 1

```
3
```

* S\_2 = `abc` equals the reversal of S\_4 = `cba`, so the second and fourth sticks are considered the same.
* S\_2 = `abc` equals S\_6 = `abc`, so the second and sixth sticks are considered the same.
* S\_3 = `de` equals S\_5 = `de`, so the third and fifth sticks are considered the same.

Therefore, there are three different sticks among the six: the first, second (same as the fourth and sixth), and third (same as the fifth).

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the program incorrectly counts the number of unique sticks by adding both the original string and its reversal to the set separately, which leads to overcounting.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

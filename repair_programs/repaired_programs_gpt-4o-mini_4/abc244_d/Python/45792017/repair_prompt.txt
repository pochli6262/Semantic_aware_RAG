## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 400 points

### Problem Statement

There are three Takahashis numbered 1, 2 and 3, and three hats colored red, green, and blue. Each Takahashi is wearing one hat. The color of the hat that Takahashi i is currently wearing is represented by a character S\_i. Here, `R` corresponds to red, `G` to green, and `B` to blue. Now, they will do the following operation **exactly** 10^{18} times.

#### Operation

* Choose two out of the three Takahashis. The two exchange the hats they are wearing.

Is it possible to make Takahashi i wearing the hat of color corresponding to character T\_i after the 10^{18} repetitions?

### Constraints

* S\_1, S\_2, S\_3 are a permutation of `R`, `G`, `B`.
* T\_1, T\_2, T\_3 are a permutation of `R`, `G`, `B`.

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
S_1 S_2 S_3
T_1 T_2 T_3
```

### Output

If it is possible to make Takahashi i wearing the hat of color corresponding to character T\_i after the 10^{18} repetitions, print `Yes`; otherwise, print `No`.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
R G B
R G B
```

### Sample Output 1

```
Yes
```

For example, the objective can be achieved by repeating 10^{18} times the operation of swapping the hats of Takahashi 1 and Takahashi 2.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The bug likely stems from an incorrect condition for checking if the hats can be swapped to match the target configuration, as it improperly evaluates the valid swaps between the Takahashis.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

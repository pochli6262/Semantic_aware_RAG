  "explanation": "The bug was in how the cost array for buying items was initialized or utilized, particularly in the way costs were calculated based on how many items had been purchased. The incorrect line was calculating the cost based on `c[i-j]` rather than `c[i]`. This aligns with the corrections suggested in related diffs where proper indexing and calculations for cumulative costs were adjusted. The fixed line now correctly uses the price for the current item being purchased when adjusting the cost, ensuring the total calculation reflects the intended logic.",

You are a Python expert.

A user gives you the following Python program which is buggy.

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 500 points

### Problem Statement

A box contains N balls, each with an integer between 1 and M-1 written on it.
For i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, the integer written on the i-th ball is A\_i.

While the box has two or more balls remaining, Takahashi will repeat the following.

* First, choose two balls arbitrarily.
* Then, get a score equal to the remainder when x^y + y^x is divided by M, where x and y are the integers written on the two balls.
* Finally, choose one of the two balls arbitrarily, eat it, and return the other to the box.

Print the maximum possible total score Takahashi will get.

### Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 500
* 2 \leq M \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq A\_i \leq M-1
* All values in the input are integers.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N M
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N
```

### Output

Print the answer.

### Sample Input 1

```
4 10
4 2 3 2
```

### Sample Output 1

```
20
```

Consider the following scenario. Below, X \bmod Y denotes the remainder when a non-negative integer X is divided by a positive integer Y.

1. Take the first and third balls from the box to score (4^3 + 3^4) \bmod 10 = 5 points. Then, eat the first ball and return the third to the box. Now, the box has the second, third, and fourth balls.
2. Take the third and fourth balls from the box to score (3^2 + 2^3) \bmod 10 = 7 points. Then, eat the third ball and return the fourth to the box. Now, the box has the second and fourth balls.
3. Take the second and fourth balls from the box to score (2^2 + 2^2) \bmod 10 = 8 points. Then, eat the second ball and return the fourth to the box. Now, the box has just the fourth ball.

Here, Takahashi scores a total of 5 + 7 + 8 = 20 points, which is the maximum possible value.

### Sample Input 2

```
20 100
29 31 68 20 83 66 23 84 69 96 41 61 83 37 52 71 18 55 40 8
```

### Sample Output 2

```
1733
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The program incorrectly tries to compute the maximum score based on connected components instead of sequentially selecting and scoring pairs of balls.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

  "explanation": "The original line 'res = a / (sum)' attempts to calculate the success rate but does not handle the case when both A_i and B_i are zero, which can lead to division by zero. The correct approach is to ensure that the success rate is calculated using the total tosses (A_i + B_i) only when the total is greater than zero. This aligns with the nature of the problem, which states that A_i + B_i is always greater than or equal to 1, preventing division by zero. Inspiration for the corrected approach comes from recognizing that we can't divide by zero, which informed the need to maintain proper input validation and calculation of success rates in this context. The diff patterns didn't provide a direct fix but emphasized careful handling of sums and calculations.",

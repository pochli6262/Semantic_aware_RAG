  "explanation": "The rotation function was incorrectly implemented for the intended matrix rotation. The correct rotation logic is to reverse the order of the rows and then transpose the matrix, which was not being handled correctly in the initial implementation. I updated the way the rotation occurs to match the expected behavior, using the fix pattern seen in the related diffs. Specifically, I changed the operation in the rotation function to properly reflect the desired rotation logic.",

  "explanation": "The bug occurs in the conditional statement that checks whether a90[j][k] == 1. The original code does not set 'ans' to False immediately upon finding a case where a90[j][k] == 1 and b[j][k] != 1, which can lead to incorrect results. I added an immediate return when this case is met to ensure that any failure condition is processed correctly. This aligns with the known fixes where a direct relationship between two lists is checked properly when seeking equality or conditions. This fix is inspired by a pattern where immediate verification is required to streamline the logic in iterative checks.",

  "explanation": "The original implementation used a reference to 'A' in the line 'A_t = A', which means that any changes to 'A_t' later affected 'A'. This was incorrect as each rotation should have worked with an independent copy of 'A'. To fix this, I changed the line to create a new list for 'A_t' initialized with the contents of 'A'. The reasoning aligns with the need to ensure that rotations do not inadvertently alter the base matrix being rotated.",

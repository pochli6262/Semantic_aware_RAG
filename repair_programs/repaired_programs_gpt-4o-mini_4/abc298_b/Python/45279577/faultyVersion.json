  "explanation": "The original line in the `is_same` function incorrectly checks for equivalence between `m` and `b` by only verifying if the elements are '1'. It should also account for the case where A has '0' but B should also have '0' in those positions. I modified the condition to check if both elements match instead of only checking for '1'. This fix was inspired by the patterns that suggest all values need to be considered for comparison.",

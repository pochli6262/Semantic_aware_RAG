  "explanation": "The original program printed the index starting from 0 even though the problem specifies that the output should be 1-based (i.e., indices start from 1). I fixed it by changing 'print(i)' to 'print(i + 1)'. This aligns with the expectation that if P_k = X, we should return k in a 1-based index format. This fix is inspired by the corrections in the diff patterns where outputs are consistently adjusted by adding 1 to the index.",
  "fixed_code": "N, X = map(int, input().split())\nP = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nfor i in range(N):\n  if P[i] == X:\n    print(i + 1)\n    break"

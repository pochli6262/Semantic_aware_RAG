{
  "explanation": "The original program used 'print(p.index(x))', which returns the index based on zero-based indexing. However, the problem statement requires the output to be in one-based indexing. To correct this, I changed the line to 'print(p.index(x) + 1)' to convert the result to one-based indexing. This correction aligns with the identified bug summary. No specific diff patterns provided direct changes, but the bug relates to indexing.",
  "fixed_code": "n, x = map(int, input().split())\np = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(p.index(x) + 1)"

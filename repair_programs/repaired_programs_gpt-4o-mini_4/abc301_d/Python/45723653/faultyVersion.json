  "explanation": "The original line responsible for evaluating the possible values from the '?' characters does not correctly address all combinations, potentially missing valid values less than or equal to N. The presence of '?' should be handled by evaluating all combinations, rather than just checking if adding a single binary value fits under N. Inspired by the diff patterns where loops or list comprehensions are used to iterate over possible combinations, I will adjust the logic to ensure all potential binary values created from the '?' replacements are taken into account.",

  "explanation": "The issue in the original `solve` function is that it does not consider all possible combinations of replacing `?` with `0` or `1`. The fix involves correctly checking and managing the impact of each `?` character on the binary value being formed without prematurely excluding values. Specifically, we need to ensure that while calculating `ans`, we also keep track of the maximum possible value generated so far that is less than or equal to `N`. This is similar to adjustments made in other diffs where the bounds and conditions for maximal checks are modified (like in Diff 5).",

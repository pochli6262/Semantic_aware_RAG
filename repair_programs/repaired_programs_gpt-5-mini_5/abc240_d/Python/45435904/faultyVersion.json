  "explanation": "The bug was that after appending the first group when Q was empty, the next if still executed and treated that newly appended group as if it were a different value, causing the count to be incremented twice. Changing the second if to elif ensures the second branch is only considered when Q was not empty, preventing double-counting. (This fix is a simple conditional ordering adjustment â€” no other logic changed.)",

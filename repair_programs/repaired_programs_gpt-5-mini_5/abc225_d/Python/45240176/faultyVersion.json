  "explanation": "The code was appending 0-based indices into the 'front' list (front.append(now)), so printed car numbers for cars before x were off by one. I fixed it by appending now+1 instead so all output uses 1-based car numbers consistently. This is an off-by-one index fix (similar in spirit to other diffs that adjusted indices).",

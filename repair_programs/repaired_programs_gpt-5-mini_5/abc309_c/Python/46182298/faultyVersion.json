  "explanation": "The bug was an off-by-one in calc: it skipped medicines with a_i == num, but those should still be taken on day num (since medicines are taken for a_i days including day 1). I changed the condition from <= to < so we only skip medicines with a_i < num and include a_i == num. This is an off-by-one fix pattern similar to the adjustments seen in the provided diffs that correct boundary conditions.",

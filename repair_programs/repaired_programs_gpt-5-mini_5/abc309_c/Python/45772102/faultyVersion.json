  "explanation": "The loop only checked whether the total pills were <= K before subtracting the current medicine, so if the total first became <= K immediately after subtracting a medicine (including after removing the last one) the code would finish the loop without printing. I fixed this by adding an immediate check right after subtracting AB[i][1] and printing AB[i][0] + 1 when that makes medicines <= K. This keeps the original structure and logic but ensures the case where the sum becomes <= K after a subtraction is handled (inspired by the idea of checking after removal as in the retrieved diffs).",

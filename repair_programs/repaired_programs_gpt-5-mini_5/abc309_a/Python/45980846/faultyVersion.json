  "explanation": "The original if-condition also checked vertical adjacency (the second OR branch comparing grid[j][i] and grid[j+1][i]), which caused vertically adjacent numbers to be considered a match. I removed that vertical check so the code only tests horizontal adjacency (inspired by the idea in the diffs to remove the extra/incorrect conditional).",

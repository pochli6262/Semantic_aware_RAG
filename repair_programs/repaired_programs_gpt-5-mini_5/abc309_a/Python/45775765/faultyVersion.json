  "explanation": "The original program only printed \"Yes\" for the explicitly listed adjacent pairs but had no default case to print \"No\" for other inputs. I fixed this by adding an else branch that prints \"No\" for all non-matching pairs. This is in line with the typical fix pattern (add an else/default output) suggested by the retrieved diffs (e.g. Diff 1 which adds an else branch to print \"No\"). Only the final print line was changed to append the else block.",

  "explanation": "The original final line compared row and column incorrectly (ax == ay) and only checked that B's column was one greater than A's (by - ay == 1). It should check that A and B are on the same row (ax == bx) and that their columns differ by 1 (abs(by - ay) == 1). I fixed that single line accordingly.",

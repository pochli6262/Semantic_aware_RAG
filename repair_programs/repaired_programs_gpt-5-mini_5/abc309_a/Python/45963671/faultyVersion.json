  "explanation": "The bug was that when b-a != 1 the code printed \"No\" but continued executing and could produce a second contradictory output. I fixed the print line to exit immediately after printing (using exit()), following the pattern of early exits used in some diffs (e.g. Diff 2 which uses print(...); exit()).",

  "explanation": "The original G list included both horizontal and vertical neighbor pairs (e.g. [1,4], [2,5], ...), so the program would report 'Yes' for vertical adjacency too. I fixed that single line by keeping only the horizontal neighbor pairs ([[1,2],[2,3],[4,5],[5,6],[7,8],[8,9]]). This corrects the adjacency check without changing any other code.",

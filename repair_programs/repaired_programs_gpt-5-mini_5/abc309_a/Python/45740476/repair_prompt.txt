## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 100 points

### Problem Statement

We have the following 3 \times 3 board with integers from 1 through 9 written on it.

![](https://img.atcoder.jp/abc309/86862b285a60054303435965fe642c67.jpg)

You are given two integers A and B between 1 and 9, where A < B.

Determine if the two squares with A and B written on them are adjacent horizontally.

### Constraints

* 1 \le A < B \le 9
* A and B are integers.

---

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
A B
```

### Output

Print `Yes` if the two squares with A and B written on them are adjacent horizontally, and `No` otherwise.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
7 8
```

### Sample Output 1

```
Yes
```

The two squares with 7 and 8 written on them are adjacent horizontally, so print `Yes`.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
1 9
```

### Sample Output 2

```
No
```

---

### Sample Input 3

```
3 4
```

### Sample Output 3

```
No
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
If b == a+1 but a is divisible by 3 (e.g., 3 4), the program produces no output because there's no else for the inner if, so it fails to print "No".

## Buggy Program
a,b=map(int,input().split())

if b==a+1:
  if a%3!=0:
    print('Yes')
else:
  print('No')

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."
}

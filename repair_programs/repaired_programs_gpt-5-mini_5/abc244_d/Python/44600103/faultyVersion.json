  "explanation": "The incorrect line was the parity check `if diff % 2 == 0:`. For permutations of 3 items the number of differing positions can be 0 (identity), 2 (a single transposition), or 3 (a 3-cycle). Only the case diff==2 is an odd permutation and therefore unreachable after an even number (10^18) of swaps. I fixed the condition to explicitly disallow diff==2 by changing it to `if diff != 2:` so that diff==0 or diff==3 (both even permutations) are accepted and diff==2 is rejected.",

  "explanation": "The original code used the Hamming distance (number of differing positions) to decide parity, but the reachable condition depends on the parity of the permutation mapping S to T (inversion parity). I replaced the single line that initialized cnt with an expression that computes: inversion_count(p) - mismatches, where p is the permutation sending S's indices to T. The subsequent three if-blocks still add the mismatches, so the final cnt becomes the inversion count. This yields the correct parity check. (This change implements the permutation-parity fix implied by the bug summary.)",

  "explanation": "The condition `if S in A == T in A:` is parsed by Python as a chained comparison (equivalent to `(S in A) and (A == T) and (T in A)`), so it doesn't compare the two membership booleans as intended. I fixed it by parenthesizing the membership tests so the code checks whether `S in A` and `T in A` are equal, i.e. both in A or both not in A.",

  "explanation": "The original code used the parity of the number of positions where S[i] == T[i], which is not the correct criterion. For 3 elements, the permutation from S to T is even (reachable after an even number of swaps) exactly when T is a cyclic rotation of S (identity or a 1-step or 2-step rotation). I fixed the single incorrect line (the final condition) to directly check whether T is a rotation of S and print Yes in that case; this yields the correct parity test for 3-element permutations.",

  "explanation": "The original code only checked if a[i][j] and a[j][i] were equal (except allowing the 'D' == 'D' case), which fails to detect mismatches like 'W' vs 'D' or the required complementary relation 'W' <-> 'L'. I replaced the equality check with an explicit verification of the complementary relations: if Player i has 'W' the counterpart must be 'L', if 'L' the counterpart must be 'W', and if 'D' the counterpart must be 'D'. This change fixes the logic while modifying exactly one line.",

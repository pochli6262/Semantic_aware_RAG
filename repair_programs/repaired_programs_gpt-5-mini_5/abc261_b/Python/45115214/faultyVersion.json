  "explanation": "The program never counted mutual draws ('D' vs 'D') as valid entries, so those positions were treated as contradictions. I fixed the single conditional that checked for a valid 'W'/'L' pair and extended it to also accept the mutual 'D' case. This adds the missing (A[i][k]=='D' and A[k][i]=='D') check while leaving the existing symmetric W/L checks intact, and avoids double-counting by only adding the draw case once for the (i,k) entry.",

  "explanation": "The original single-line condition only flagged cases where both entries were the same wrong value (W/W or L/L). The rule should instead flag any mismatch of expected reciprocal results: W must pair with L, L with W, and D with D. I replaced that single if-condition with one that checks these three reciprocity rules (if A[i][j] is 'W' but A[j][i] isn't 'L', etc.).",

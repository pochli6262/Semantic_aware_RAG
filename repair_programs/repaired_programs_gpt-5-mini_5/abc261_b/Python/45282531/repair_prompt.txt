## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 200 points

### Problem Statement

N players played a round-robin tournament.

You are given an N-by-N table A containing the results of the matches. Let A\_{i,j} denote the element at the i-th row and j-th column of A.  
A\_{i,j} is `-` if i=j, and `W`, `L`, or `D` otherwise.  
A\_{i,j} is `W` if Player i beat Player j, `L` if Player i lost to Player j, and `D` if Player i drew with Player j.

Determine whether the given table is contradictory.

The table is said to be contradictory when some of the following holds:

* There is a pair (i,j) such that Player i beat Player j, but Player j did not lose to Player i;
* There is a pair (i,j) such that Player i lost to Player j, but Player j did not beat Player i;
* There is a pair (i,j) such that Player i drew with Player j, but Player j did not draw with Player i.

### Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 1000
* A\_{i,i} is `-`.
* A\_{i,j} is `W`, `L`, or `D`, for i\neq j.

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
A_{1,1}A_{1,2}\ldots A_{1,N}
A_{2,1}A_{2,2}\ldots A_{2,N}
\vdots
A_{N,1}A_{N,2}\ldots A_{N,N}
```

### Output

If the given table is not contradictory, print `correct`; if it is contradictory, print `incorrect`.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
4
-WWW
L-DD
LD-W
LDW-
```

### Sample Output 1

```
incorrect
```

Player 3 beat Player 4, while Player 4 also beat Player 3, which is contradictory.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
2
-D
D-
```

### Sample Output 2

```
correct
```

There is no contradiction.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The code only checks for both-'W' or both-'L' pairs and thus fails to detect contradictions where, for example, 'W' is paired with 'D' or any case where 'W' is not matched by 'L' or 'D' is not matched by 'D'.

## Buggy Program
N = int(input())
A = [list(input()) for _ in range(N)]

for i in range(N):
  for j in range(N):
    if A[i][j] == 'W' and A[j][i] =='W' or A[i][j] == 'L' and A[j][i] =='L':
      print('incorrect')
      exit()
print('correct')

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

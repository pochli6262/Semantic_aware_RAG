  "explanation": "The check for the 'L' case was inverted: when kama[i][ipp] == 'L' the opposite entry kama[ipp][i] must be 'W', so we should flag a contradiction when it is not 'W'. The original line used '==' and only flagged when the opposite was 'W' (the exact opposite). I fixed it by changing '==' to '!=' so the program now correctly prints 'incorrect' when the opposite entry is anything other than 'W'.",

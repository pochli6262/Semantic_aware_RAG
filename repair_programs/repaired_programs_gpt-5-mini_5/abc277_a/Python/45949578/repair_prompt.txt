You are a Python expert.

A user gives you the following Python program which is buggy.

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 100 points

### Problem Statement

You are given a sequence P that is a permutation of (1,2,…,N), and an integer X.
The i-th term of P has a value of P\_i.
Print k such that P\_k = X.

### Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq X \leq N
* P is a permutation of (1,2,…,N).
* All values in the input are integers.

---

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N X
P_1 P_2 \ldots P_N
```

### Output

Print the answer.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
4 3
2 3 1 4
```

### Sample Output 1

```
2
```

We have P = (2,3,1,4), so P\_2 = 3. Thus, you should print 2.

### Sample Input 2

```
5 2
3 5 1 4 2
```

### Sample Output 2

```
5
```

---

### Sample Input 3

```
6 6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

### Sample Output 3

```
6
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The program prints the zero-based index of X in P instead of the required one-based position.

## Buggy Program
N, X = map(int, input().split())
P = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(N):
  if P[i] == X:
    print(i)
    break

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line — all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."
}

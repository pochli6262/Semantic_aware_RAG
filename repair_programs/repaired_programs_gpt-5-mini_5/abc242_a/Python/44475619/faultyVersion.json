  "explanation": "The program printed D/C (the reciprocal) instead of C/D when computing the probability for the random selection case. I fixed the single incorrect line by printing C/D so the probability is computed as (number chosen) / (number of eligible participants). This directly addresses the bug; no related diff was needed for this simple arithmetic fix.",

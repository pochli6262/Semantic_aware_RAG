  "explanation": "The boundary check for the random-selection range was off by one: participants ranked between A+1 and B (inclusive) should be eligible, but the code used 'X < B' which excluded rank B. I fixed that single line to use '<=' so X==B is treated as eligible. This is an off-by-one correction similar in spirit to fixes that extend range bounds (see Diff 3 pattern).",

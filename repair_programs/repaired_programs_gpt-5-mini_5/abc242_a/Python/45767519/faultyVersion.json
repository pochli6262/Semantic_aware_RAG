  "explanation": "The condition that checks whether X is in the randomly selected range used C instead of B. The line 'elif X > A and X <= C:' incorrectly tests against C, so ranks between A+1 and B were misclassified. I changed it to 'elif X > A and X <= B:' so the random-selection range is tested correctly. (This fixes the single-line conditional bug described in the analysis.)",

  "explanation": "The bug was a single incorrect assignment in the branch for 5-digit numbers: the code set l[1] = 1 which wrongly altered the tens digit instead of zeroing it. I changed that line to l[1] = 0 so both the ones and tens digits are truncated for 5-digit N, matching the problem statement. This is a one-line fix; no other logic was modified.",

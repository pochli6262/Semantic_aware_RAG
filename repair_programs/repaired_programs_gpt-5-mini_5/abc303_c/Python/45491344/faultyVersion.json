  "explanation": "The bug was using the equality operator '==' instead of the assignment operator '=' when trying to mark an item as consumed: `item[(now[0],now[1])] == 0` does nothing, so items were never removed and could be reused. I fixed that single line to assign 0 to the dictionary entry, preventing reuse of the item.",

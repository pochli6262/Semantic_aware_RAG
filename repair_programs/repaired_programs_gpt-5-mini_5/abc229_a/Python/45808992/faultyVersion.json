  "explanation": "The initial if condition only checked for a full row of blacks (\"##\") in either row, so it missed the cases where the two black squares form a vertical column (S1 == S2 == \"#.\" or S1 == S2 == \".#\"). I fixed the single condition line to also accept S1 == S2, which covers those vertical adjacency cases. This change is a simple addition of an OR clause (inspired by the logical-operator fixes seen in Diff 3) and does not alter any other logic.",

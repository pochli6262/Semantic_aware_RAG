  "explanation": "The original if-condition compared characters across rows (S1[0] == S2[0] or S1[1] == S2[1]) instead of checking whether those positions are black ('#') and it also missed horizontal adjacency checks. I replaced that single line with a condition that explicitly tests all four side-adjacency possibilities (two horizontal and two vertical). This fix follows the idea from the retrieved diffs that boolean conditions needed correction (use of proper comparisons and correct combination with 'or').",

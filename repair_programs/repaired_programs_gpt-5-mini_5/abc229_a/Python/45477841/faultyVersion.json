  "explanation": "The original if only detected one diagonal-disconnected pattern (S1 == \".#\" and S2 == \"#.\") but missed the symmetric case (S1 == \"#.\" and S2 == \".#\"). I fixed the condition to check either diagonal pattern using an OR. This mirrors the fix pattern in Diff 2 which changed an AND to an OR to accept either alternative.",

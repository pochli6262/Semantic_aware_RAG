  "explanation": "The function fell through without producing output when there were exactly two black squares that were adjacent: the lone `return` after the diagonal check caused the function to exit silently instead of printing Yes for the non-diagonal (adjacent) case. I replaced that single `return` line with an `else: print(\"Yes\")` so that when the diagonal check is false (i.e., the two blacks are adjacent) the function prints \"Yes\". This is a one-line fix that preserves the original control flow and intent.",

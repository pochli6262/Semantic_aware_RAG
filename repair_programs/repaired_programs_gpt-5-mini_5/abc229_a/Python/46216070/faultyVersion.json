  "explanation": "The if condition used `or [\".#\",\"#.\"]` which is a non-empty list and thus always truthy, so the condition always evaluated to True and the program always printed \"No\". I fixed it by comparing [s1, s2] to the second pattern as well (i.e. repeating the comparison). This follows the same pattern used in fixes where each comparison must be explicit instead of relying on a bare truthy value.",
  "fixed_code": "s1 = input()\ns2 = input()\n\nif [s1, s2] == [\"#.\",\".#\"] or [s1, s2] == [\".#\",\"#.\"]:\n    print('No')\n    exit()\nelse:\n    print('Yes')\n"

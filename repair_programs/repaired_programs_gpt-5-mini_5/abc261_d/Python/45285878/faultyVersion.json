  "explanation": "The bug was in the transition that sets dp[i][0]. The original line used max(dp[i-2]) and added xl[i] + yl[j], incorrectly referencing two-steps-back and reusing j; the correct transition for a tail is to reset the streak and take the maximum over the previous row, i.e. dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1]). I fixed that single line to use max(dp[i-1]) and removed the incorrect additions and dp[i-2] reference.",

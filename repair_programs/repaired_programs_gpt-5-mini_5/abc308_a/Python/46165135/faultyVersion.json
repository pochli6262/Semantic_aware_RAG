  "explanation": "The monotonicity check was wrong: the code used `if S[i] >= S[i + 1]:` which treats equal adjacent values as a violation. The condition should only fail when a later element is strictly smaller than a previous one, so it must be `if S[i] > S[i + 1]:`. I changed that single comparison to allow non-decreasing sequences with equal elements.",

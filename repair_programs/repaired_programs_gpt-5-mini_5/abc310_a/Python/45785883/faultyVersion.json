  "explanation": "The buggy line computed the coupon scenario as p - q + a[i], which is wrong: the discounted drink costs Q, so the total when using the coupon is Q + D_i. I changed the expression to q + a[i]. This is a straightforward arithmetic-expression fix similar in spirit to the small expression replacements shown in the retrieved diffs.",

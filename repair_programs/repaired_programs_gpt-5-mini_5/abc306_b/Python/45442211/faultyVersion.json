  "explanation": "The for loop used range(63), which iterates indices 0 through 62 and therefore omits the last element A[63]; I changed it to range(64) so the loop includes index 63 and accounts for the final bit. This fix is analogous to the pattern in Diff 3 where the loop upper bound was increased by 1 to include the missing case.",
  "fixed_code": "A = list(map(int,input().split()))\nS = 0\n\nimport math\n\nfor i in range(64):\n    S = S + A[i]*(pow(2,i))\n    \nprint(S)"

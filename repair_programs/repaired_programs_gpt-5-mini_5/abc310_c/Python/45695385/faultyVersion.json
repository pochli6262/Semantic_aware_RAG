  "explanation": "The original code only special-cased single-character strings (if len(s)==1) when ensuring palindromic sticks produce two distinct markers in the set. That fails for palindromes longer than one (e.g., \"aa\"), which would lead to only one set entry and an incorrect count after dividing by two. I changed the condition to check whether the string equals its reversal (if s==t) so all palindromes are handled correctly. (This fix is guided by reasoning about the set-pairing approach rather than any of the retrieved diffs.)",

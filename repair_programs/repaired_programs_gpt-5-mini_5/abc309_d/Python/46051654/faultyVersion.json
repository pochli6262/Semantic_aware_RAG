  "explanation": "The BFS (named dfs) always enqueued node 0 (q.append(0)) instead of enqueuing the requested start node s, so distances were computed from the wrong source. I fixed that line to q.append(s) so the search begins from the given start. (This is a straightforward single-line correction to start BFS from s.)",

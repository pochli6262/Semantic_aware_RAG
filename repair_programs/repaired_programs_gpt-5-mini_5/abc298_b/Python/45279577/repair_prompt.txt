## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 200 points

### Problem Statement

You are given N-by-N matrices A and B where each element is 0 or 1.  
Let A\_{i,j} and B\_{i,j} denote the element at the i-th row and j-th column of A and B, respectively.  
Determine whether it is possible to rotate A so that B\_{i,j} = 1 for every pair of integers (i, j) such that A\_{i,j} = 1.  
Here, to rotate A is to perform the following operation zero or more times:

* for every pair of integers (i, j) such that 1 \leq i, j \leq N, simultaneously replace A\_{i,j} with A\_{N + 1 - j,i}.

### Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* Each element of A and B is 0 or 1.
* All values in the input are integers.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
A_{1,1} A_{1,2} \ldots A_{1,N}
\vdots
A_{N,1} A_{N,2} \ldots A_{N,N}
B_{1,1} B_{1,2} \ldots B_{1,N}
\vdots
B_{N,1} B_{N,2} \ldots B_{N,N}
```

### Output

If it is possible to rotate A so that B\_{i,j} = 1 for every pair of integers (i, j) such that A\_{i,j} = 1, print `Yes`; otherwise, print `No`.

### Sample Input 1

```
3
0 1 1
1 0 0
0 1 0
1 1 0
0 0 1
1 1 1
```

### Sample Output 1

```
Yes
```

Initially, A is :

```
0 1 1
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

After performing the operation once, A is :

```
0 1 0
1 0 1 
0 0 1
```

After performing the operation once again, A is :

```
0 1 0
0 0 1
1 1 0
```

Here, B\_{i,j} = 1 for every pair of integers (i, j) such that A\_{i,j} = 1, so you should print `Yes`.

No
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The program never checks the original (zero-rotation) matrix, only testing the three nonzero rotations (90°, 180°, 270°), so it misses the 0° case.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line — all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

  "explanation": "The loop only iterated 3 times, so the program never tested the original (zero-rotation) orientation of A. Changing the loop from for _ in range(3): to for _ in range(4): makes the fourth rotation bring A back to its original orientation, so that case is checked as well. No other lines were changed.",

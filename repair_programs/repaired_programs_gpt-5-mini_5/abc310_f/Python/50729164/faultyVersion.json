  "explanation": "The loop over face values omitted outcomes greater than 10, so faces >10 (which should act as a \"no-change\" transition for sums up to 10) were never accounted for. The simplest single-line fix is to iterate over all face values 1..A_i (for which modulo clipping makes larger shifts have no effect on the 10-bit mask), ensuring those no-change outcomes contribute their probability mass. I changed the for-loop header to iterate through range(1, a[i]+1) so faces >10 are included (they produce nex==0 modulo 1<<10 and thus correctly add to the unchanged mask).",

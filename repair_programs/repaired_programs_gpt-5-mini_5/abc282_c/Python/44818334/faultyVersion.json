  "explanation": "The original code replaced commas when cnt%2==1 (i.e., inside quoted/enclosed segments). We should replace commas that are NOT enclosed, i.e., when the quote count is even (cnt%2==0). I fixed the single incorrect conditional by changing 'if cnt%2==1:' to 'if cnt%2==0:'. No retrieved diff was directly applicable to this simple logic fix.",

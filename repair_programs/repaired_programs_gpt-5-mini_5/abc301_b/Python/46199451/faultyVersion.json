  "explanation": "The program was printing the Python list object (with brackets and commas) because the line print(ans_list) prints the list representation. I replaced it with print(*ans_list) so the list is unpacked and printed as space-separated integers. This fix follows the common pattern seen in the retrieved diffs (e.g., diff 5 using print(*...)).",

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 400 points

### Problem Statement

How many positive integers no greater than N can be represented as a^2 \times b \times c^2 with three **primes** a,b, and c such that a<b<c?

### Constraints

* N is an integer satisfying 300 \le N \le 10^{12}.

---

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
```

### Output

Print the answer as an integer.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
1000
```

### Sample Output 1

```
3
```

The conforming integers no greater than 1000 are the following three.

* 300 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5^2
* 588 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 7^2
* 980 = 2^2 \times 5 \times 7^2

### Sample Input 2

```
1000000000000
```

### Sample Output 2

```
2817785
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The program uses a hardcoded n = 10**12 instead of reading the input value N from standard input.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

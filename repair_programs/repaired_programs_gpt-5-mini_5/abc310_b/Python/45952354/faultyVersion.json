  "explanation": "The conditional line in the pairwise check was wrong: it compared P[i] to itself (P[i] >= P[i]) instead of to P[j], and used (F[i] - F[j]) instead of testing whether F[j] is a strict superset of F[i]. I replaced that single line with the correct condition: P[i] >= P[j] and F[j] >= F[i] and (P[i] > P[j] or (F[j] > F[i])). This fix follows the same logic as shown in the retrieved diff that corrected the comparison to use '>=' for prices and '>' for strict superset of functions.",

  "explanation": "The code treated identical products as 'strictly superior' because it only checked p[i] >= p[j] and f[j].issuperset(f[i]) but didn't require a strict advantage (either a strictly higher price or a strictly larger function set). I fixed the condition by adding a strictness check: (p[i] > p[j] or f[j] > f[i]). This follows the intent shown in the retrieved diffs (notably the pattern in Diff 1 / Diff 3 that enforces the additional strict condition).",

  "explanation": "The bug was the line product.sort(reverse=True). That does a full-row lexicographic sort (price, count, function IDs) and can reorder products with the same price so that a candidate pair (i,j) with Pi==Pj and Fi subset of Fj is missed when the superset appears earlier. I fixed it by sorting only by price descending and function-count ascending (product.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))), which guarantees that for equal prices the product with fewer functions (the possible subset) comes before the superset so the existing i<j checks will find the pair. This change is in the spirit of handling equal-price ordering issues (similar reasoning as in the retrieved diffs that handled ordering/length).",

  "explanation": "The program read the first input line as a raw string and then took only the first and last characters (int(a[0]) and int(a[-1])), which fails for multi-digit H or W. I changed the line to split the input into tokens so b and c parse the full numbers correctly (a = input().split()). This fixes the dimension parsing while leaving the rest of the code unchanged.",

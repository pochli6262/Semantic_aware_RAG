  "explanation": "The line ans = N + a - 1 incorrectly computes the next multiple of 5 for remainder a == 4 (it produces N+3 instead of N+1). The correct amount to add to reach the next water station is (5 - a). I fixed the off-by-one arithmetic by replacing ans = N + a - 1 with ans = N + (5 - a). This is an off-by-one style correction similar to fixes shown in the diffs (e.g., adjusting +/-1 errors).",

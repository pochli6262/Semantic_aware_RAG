  "explanation": "The branch for n%5 == 0 incorrectly printed 0 instead of the actual position n of the water station. When N is exactly at a station, the nearest station is N itself. I fixed the single-line mistake by printing n instead of 0. This follows the same simple literal-to-variable correction pattern seen in other small diffs that replace an incorrect constant with the correct value.",

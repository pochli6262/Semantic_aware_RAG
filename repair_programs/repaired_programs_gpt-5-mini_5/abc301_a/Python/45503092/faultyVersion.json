  "explanation": "The bug was that S = input().split() produced a list (with the whole string as a single element) instead of the game-result string, so S.count('T') and S.count('A') returned wrong values and S[-1] was the full string rather than the last character. I fixed that line to read the raw string (stripping trailing newline) with input().strip(), leaving the rest of the logic unchanged.",

  "explanation": "The bug was the win-threshold expression N/2+1: using floating division (and adding 1) made the early-stop condition wrong (it failed for odd N). I replaced the threshold with integer arithmetic N//2 + 1 so the program correctly detects when a player has an insurmountable majority (this is the one logical fix inspired by the analysis of the threshold; it corresponds to changing the incorrect N/2+1 usage to integer division +1).",

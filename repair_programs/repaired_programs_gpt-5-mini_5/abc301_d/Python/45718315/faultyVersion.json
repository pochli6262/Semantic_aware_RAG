  "explanation": "The loop never added the contribution of fixed '1' bits to the final answer â€” it only removed their contribution from min_val. I changed the single line that handled '1' positions so that it both adds the mask to ans (so fixed 1 bits are included in the result) and still subtracts the mask from min_val to keep the remaining-min calculation correct. (No external diff was required; this directly addresses the bug described.)",

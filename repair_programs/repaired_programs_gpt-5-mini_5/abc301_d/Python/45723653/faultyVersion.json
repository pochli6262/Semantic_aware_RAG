  "explanation": "The loop that assigns '?' bits was iterating from least-significant to most-significant bit (for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1)), which greedily filled low bits and could prevent setting higher bits that yield a larger valid number ≤ N. I changed that single line to iterate from most-significant to least-significant (for i in range(m)) so we try to set higher bits first and maximize the result while staying ≤ N. (No retrieved diffs were directly applicable; the fix is a straightforward correction of the iteration order.)",

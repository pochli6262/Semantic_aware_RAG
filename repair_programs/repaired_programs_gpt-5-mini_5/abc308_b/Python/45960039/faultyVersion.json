  "explanation": "The incorrect line printed p[0] for each plate color not found in the price map, which produced extra output and failed to accumulate the default price into the total. I replaced the stray print(p[0]) with s += p[0] so the default price is added to the running sum. (This follows the common fix pattern of removing an unintended print and using accumulation, similar in spirit to diffs that remove stray prints like Diff 1 and Diff 4.)",

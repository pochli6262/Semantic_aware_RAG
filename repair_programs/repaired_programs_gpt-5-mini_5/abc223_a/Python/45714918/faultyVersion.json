  "explanation": "The original single-line condition only checked x%100==0, which incorrectly accepted X=0 (no coins). I fixed that line to also require x>=100 so that at least one 100-yen coin is present. This change is similar in spirit to diffs that add an extra logical check using 'and' to enforce an additional constraint (see patterns like Diff 2).",
  "fixed_code": "x = int(input())\nprint('Yes' if x%100==0 and x>=100 else 'No')"

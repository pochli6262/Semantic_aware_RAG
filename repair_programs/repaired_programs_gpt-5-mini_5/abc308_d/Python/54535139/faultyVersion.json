  "explanation": "The code was marking neighbor cells as seen before checking whether the neighbor's letter matches the required character from \"snuke\". This prematurely blocks exploration of valid paths. I changed the single incorrect line (the unconditional seen[ny][nx] = True) so that a cell is marked seen only if it matches the expected character. This keeps the rest of the logic identical and prevents non-matching neighbors from being marked. (The fix follows the idea of checking before marking.)",

{
  "explanation": "The final condition used `t < 0`, which incorrectly allows the case where time becomes exactly zero after the final moves. According to the problem a move that makes the time limit 0 or less is disallowed, so the check must be `t <= 0`. This is an off-by-one/boundary fix on the inequality (similar in spirit to the diff patterns that adjust comparison operators).",

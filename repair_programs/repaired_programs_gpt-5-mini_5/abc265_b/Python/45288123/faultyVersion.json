  "explanation": "The problem states Takahashi cannot make a move that makes the time limit 0 or less. The buggy line used `if T < 0:` which only disallows negative time but (incorrectly) allows T == 0 after a move. I changed the check to `if T <= 0:` so moves that reduce the time to exactly zero are also forbidden. This is a simple '<' -> '<=' fix pattern similar to fixes in the retrieved diffs where boundary comparisons were tightened.",

  "explanation": "The incorrect line compared the remaining time t to the loop index i (if t>i:) instead of to the required move cost a[i]. That caused incorrect decisions about whether a move is possible. I fixed it by changing the comparison to if t> a[i]: so we check that the current time is strictly greater than the move cost before subtracting it (matching the rule that time must remain > 0 after the move).",

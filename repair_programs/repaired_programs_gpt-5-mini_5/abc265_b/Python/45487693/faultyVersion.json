  "explanation": "The original code allowed a move that left the time limit exactly 0 because it only checked if t - s[now-1] < 0. According to the problem, moves that make the time limit 0 or less are disallowed, so the condition must be <= 0. I changed the single comparison from '< 0' to '<= 0' to enforce that. (This is a simple inequality fix similar in spirit to patterns seen in the provided diffs where boundary comparisons were corrected.)",

  "explanation": "The program allowed a move that would reduce the time limit to exactly zero because the check used 'A[i] > T' instead of disallowing moves when 'A[i] >= T'. I changed that single comparison to 'A[i] >= T' so a move that would make the time limit 0 (or negative) is correctly prevented. This fix is the same kind of off-by-equality correction seen in the retrieved diffs (changes like '<=' to '<' or '>' to '<=' patterns).",

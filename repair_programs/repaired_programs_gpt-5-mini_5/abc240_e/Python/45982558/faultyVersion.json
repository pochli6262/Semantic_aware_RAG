  "explanation": "The original leaf check used `if len(graph[v])==1 and visited[v]:`, which is wrong because `visited[v]` is always true inside dfs (we mark nodes visited before recursing), causing the root to be misclassified as a leaf when it has one neighbor and failing for the single-node tree (degree 0). I replaced that single condition with an explicit leaf test: a non-root node with degree 1 is a leaf, or the root with degree 0 is a leaf. This fixes misclassification while changing only one line.",

  "explanation": "The program always printed \"No\" after the loop even when a valid permutation was found and the loop was broken out of. I fixed that by changing the final unconditional print to a for-else construct so that \"No\" is printed only when the loop completes normally (i.e., no break). This preserves the original logic and fixes the bug without restructuring code.",

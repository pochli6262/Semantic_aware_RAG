## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 250 points

### Problem Statement

You are given N strings S\_1,S\_2,\dots,S\_N, each of length M, consisting of lowercase English letter. Here, S\_i are pairwise distinct.

Determine if one can rearrange these strings to obtain a new sequence of strings T\_1,T\_2,\dots,T\_N such that:

* for all integers i such that 1 \le i \le N-1, one can alter exactly one character of T\_i to another lowercase English letter to make it equal to T\_{i+1}.

### Constraints

* 2 \le N \le 8
* 1 \le M \le 5
* S\_i is a string of length M consisting of lowercase English letters. (1 \le i \le N)
* S\_i are pairwise distinct.

---

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N M
S_1
S_2
\vdots
S_N
```

### Output

Print `Yes` if one can obtain a conforming sequence; print `No` otherwise.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
4 4
bbed
abcd
abed
fbed
```

### Sample Output 1

```
Yes
```

One can rearrange them in this order: `abcd`, `abed`, `bbed`, `fbed`. This sequence satisfies the condition.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
2 5
abcde
abced
```

### Sample Output 2

```
No
```

No matter how the strings are rearranged, the condition is never satisfied.

---

### Sample Input 3

```
8 4
fast
face
cast
race
fact
rice
nice
case
```

### Sample Output 3

```
Yes
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The code incorrectly uses itertools.product(S, repeat=N), which allows repeated strings and doesn't enforce using each input exactly once, instead of generating permutations (rearrangements without repetition).

## Buggy Program
import itertools
S = []
N,M = map(int,input().split())
for _ in range(N):
  s = list(input())
  S.append(s)
com = itertools.product(S,repeat = N)
for co in com:
  ans = "Yes"
  for k in range(len(co)-1):
    no = 0
    for j in range(M):
      if co[k][j] != co[k+1][j]:
        no+=1
    if no != 1:
      ans = "No"
  if ans == "Yes":
    print(ans)
    exit()
print(ans)

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

  "explanation": "The program created the answer list with length based on H (ans = [0 for _ in range(H+1)]), but the problem requires counts up to N = min(H, W). I changed that single line to use min(H, W) so the answer vector has the correct length. This fix follows the problem statement's definition of N = min(H, W).",

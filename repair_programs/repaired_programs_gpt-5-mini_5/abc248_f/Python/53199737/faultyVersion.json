  "explanation": "The program printed the entire last row con[-1], which includes the m=0 case, producing N values. The problem asks for answers for i=1..N-1 (N-1 values). I changed the final print to output con[-1][1:], i.e. skip the m=0 entry. This is an off-by-one output fix (in spirit similar to off-by-one fixes like the one in Diff 3).",

{
  "explanation": "The neighbor map p included vertical neighbors (e.g. 1:(2, 4)), so the program could report 'Yes' for vertically adjacent squares. I replaced the p dictionary so each key lists only its horizontal neighbors (1-2, 2-3, 4-5, 5-6, 7-8, 8-9). This fixes the incorrect adjacency mapping; it's equivalent in intent to checks like B-A==1 with a row-boundary guard (see diff patterns that check B-A==1).",
  "fixed_code": "p = {1:(2,), 2:(1,3), 3:(2,), 4:(5,), 5:(4,6), 6:(5,), 7:(8,), 8:(7,9), 9:(8,)}\n\nA, B = map(int, input().split())\n\nif B in p[A]:\n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No\")"

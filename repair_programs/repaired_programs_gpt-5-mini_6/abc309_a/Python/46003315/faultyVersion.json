  "explanation": "The single incorrect line was the final print condition: it compared ax == ay (A's row to A's column) instead of comparing A's row to B's row. I changed ax == ay to ax == bx so the code checks that A and B are on the same row and that B's column is exactly one to the right of A. (This aligns with the simple check B-A == 1 used in related fixes for horizontal adjacency.)",

  "explanation": "The condition mistakenly allowed a difference of 3 by using 'abs(a-b) in [1,3]'; that makes vertically adjacent numbers be treated as horizontal. I changed that single condition to require 'abs(a-b) == 1' so only immediate horizontal neighbors are accepted (inspired by diffs that enforce difference == 1).",
  "fixed_code": "a,b=map(int,input().split())\nif set([a,b]) not in [{3,4},{6,7}] and abs(a-b) == 1:\n  print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n  print(\"No\")"

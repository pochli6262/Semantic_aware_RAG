  "explanation": "The original conditional also checked vertical adjacency (the second half: (a[k%2] == grid[j][i] and a[(k+1)%2] == grid[j+1][i])), which caused \"Yes\" to be printed for vertically adjacent numbers even though only horizontal adjacency should count. I fixed it by removing the vertical check and keeping only the horizontal adjacency check. This follows the intended logic described in the problem and mirrors the idea of restricting the condition to the correct adjacency (similar in spirit to diffs that tighten or correct conditional checks).",

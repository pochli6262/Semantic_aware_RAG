  "explanation": "The original program printed \"No\" for the b-a != 1 case but did not stop, so execution continued and could print another (incorrect) result. I fixed the single incorrect line by adding an immediate exit() after printing \"No\" so the program short-circuits and doesn't continue to the later checks. This implements the intended early return behavior (inspired by the bug summary that the code should stop after the first No).",

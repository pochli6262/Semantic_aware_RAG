  "explanation": "The bug was in the definition of G: it included vertical neighbor pairs (e.g. [1,4], [2,5], [3,6], etc.), so the program could treat vertical adjacencies as horizontal. I fixed that line by removing the vertical pairs and leaving only the horizontal neighbor pairs [1,2], [2,3], [4,5], [5,6], [7,8], [8,9]. This matches the problem requirement to check only horizontal adjacency.",

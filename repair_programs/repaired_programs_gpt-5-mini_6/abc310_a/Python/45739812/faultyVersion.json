  "explanation": "The wrong line computed the coupon total as P - Q + d, which is incorrect; the discounted drink costs Q (not P - Q), so the total with a dish should be Q + d. I fixed the line to assign p := Q + d so we compare the correct total. (No retrieved diff directly applied; this is a simple arithmetic correction.)",

  "explanation": "The 'L' case checked the opponent's result with the wrong condition: it flagged a contradiction when the opponent had 'W' instead of when the opponent did NOT have 'W'. I changed the equality check to an inequality (== -> !=) so that if player i has 'L', we require player j to have 'W'; otherwise it's 'incorrect'. This is a simple fix changing the condition from positive to negative, similar in spirit to diffs that flip comparison operators.",

  "explanation": "The bug was in the condition that treated any matching non-'D' entries as an automatic contradiction by checking equality (if a[i][j] == b[i][j]). That misses invalid asymmetric pairs like 'W' vs 'D' and accepts only equality rather than the required complementary pairs. I replaced that single equality check with an explicit validity test: continue when the pair is one of the allowed combinations ('D'/'D', 'W'/'L', or 'L'/'W'), and mark incorrect otherwise. This fixes the logic while changing exactly one line.",

  "explanation": "The original condition only detected symmetric 'W'/'W' or 'L'/'L' pairs and missed other contradictions (like 'W' vs 'D', 'W' vs '-', etc.). I replaced that single if condition so it explicitly checks that 'W' must be paired with 'L', 'L' must be paired with 'W', and 'D' must be paired with 'D'. This ensures any mismatch is flagged as 'incorrect'. (No retrieved diff was directly applicable.)",

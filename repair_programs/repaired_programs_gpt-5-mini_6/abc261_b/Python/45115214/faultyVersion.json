  "explanation": "The code never checked that 'D' entries are symmetric (A[i][k] == 'D' requires A[k][i] == 'D'), so draws could be mismatched and the table would be accepted incorrectly. I fixed the single condition line to also accept the symmetric 'D' case in addition to the existing W/L checks. (This change follows the pattern of extending a conditional to include an additional valid case.)",

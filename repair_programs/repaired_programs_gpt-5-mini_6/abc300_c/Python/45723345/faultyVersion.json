  "explanation": "The code allocated the answers array with length based on H (ans = [0 for _ in range(H+1)]), but the maximum possible cross size is N = min(H, W). Using H causes the program to output the wrong number of counts when W < H. I fixed that line to allocate ans with length min(H, W) + 1 so counts and output match the required N. (This is a straightforward bounds fix â€” analogous to fixes that replace a fixed dimension with min(H,W).)",

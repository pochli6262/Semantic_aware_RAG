You are a Python expert.

A user gives you the following Python program which is buggy.

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 100 points

### Problem Statement

You are given integers a, b, c, and d. Print two lines as follows.

The first line should contain the result of calculating (a + b) \times (c - d) as an integer.  
The second line should contain `Takahashi`, regardless of the input.

### Constraints

* -100 \leq a, b, c, d \leq 100
* a, b, c, and d are integers.

---

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
a b c d 
```

### Output

Print two lines according to the Problem Statement.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
1 2 5 3
```

### Sample Output 1

```
6
Takahashi
```

We have (1 + 2) \times(5 - 3) = 3 \times 2 = 6, so the first line should contain 6.  
The second line should contain `Takahashi`. Lowercasing the first character or incorrect spelling will not be accepted, so be careful.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
10 -20 30 -40
```

### Sample Output 2

```
-700
Takahashi
```

The input or output may contain negative numbers.

---

### Sample Input 3

```
100 100 100 -100
```

### Sample Output 3

```
40000
Takahashi
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The program mistakenly uses (a - d) as the second factor instead of (c - d), so it computes (a + b) * (a - d) rather than (a + b) * (c - d).

## Buggy Program
a, b, c, d  = map(int, input().split())
print(((a + b) * (a - d)))
print("Takahashi")

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."
}

  "explanation": "The original code treated identical products (same price and same function set) as a valid 'strictly superior' pair because it only checked p[i] >= p[j] and f[j].issuperset(f[i]). The specification requires an additional strictness: either p[i] > p[j] or the j-th product must have at least one function that i lacks (i.e. f[j] must be a strict superset). I fixed the single line to require that f[j] is a superset AND that either the price is strictly greater or the function set is strictly larger. This enforces the required strictness (inspired by patterns in the provided diffs that add explicit strict checks).",

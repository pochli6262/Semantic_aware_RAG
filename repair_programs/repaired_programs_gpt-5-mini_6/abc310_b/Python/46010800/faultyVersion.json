  "explanation": "The inner loop only iterated j in range(i), so only pairs with j < i were checked and many ordered (i, j) pairs were missed. I changed that single line to iterate j over all products (range(n)) so every ordered pair (i, j) is considered. This fixes the logic without restructuring other code.",

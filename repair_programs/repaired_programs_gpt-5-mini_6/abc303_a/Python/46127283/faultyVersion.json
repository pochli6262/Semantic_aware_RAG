  "explanation": "The elif condition mistakenly checked t[i] == \"o\" instead of checking s[i] == \"o\", so the 0/o similarity branch could be entered incorrectly and compared t against itself. I fixed that single line to test s[i] for both '0' and 'o', making the code symmetric (check s in the elif, then check t inside) and correctly implementing the 0/o similarity rule. This change follows the bug summary identifying the wrong variable in that condition.",

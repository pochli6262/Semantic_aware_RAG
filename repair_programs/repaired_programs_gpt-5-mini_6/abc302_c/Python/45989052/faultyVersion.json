  "explanation": "The bug was that after finding a valid permutation the code printed \"Yes\" but only executed `break`, so execution continued past the loop and always printed the final \"No\". I replaced the single incorrect line `break` with `exit()` so the program terminates immediately after printing \"Yes\" and never reaches the final `print(\"No\")` (this is a minimal one-line fix).",

  "explanation": "The loop was iterating over S[:-1], omitting the final move; this is an off-by-one error. I fixed it by iterating over all characters in S (for s in S). This is a standard off-by-one correction similar in spirit to other diffs that address boundary errors (e.g., off-by-one checks in Diff1 and Diff5).",

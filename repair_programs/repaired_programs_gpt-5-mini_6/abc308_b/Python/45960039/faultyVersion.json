  "explanation": "The bug was that for plate colors not found in ds the code did print(p[0]) (which produced extra output lines) instead of adding the default price to the running total. I changed that single line to accumulate the default price into s (s += p[0]). This fixes the incorrect output while leaving the rest of the program unchanged.",

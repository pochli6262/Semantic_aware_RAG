Score : 200 points

### Problem Statement

Takahashi ate N plates of sushi at a sushi restaurant. The color of the i-th plate is represented by a string C\_i.

The price of a sushi corresponds to the color of the plate. For each i=1,\ldots,M, the sushi on a plate whose color is represented by a string D\_i is worth P\_i yen a plate (yen is the currency of Japan). If the color does not coincide with any of D\_1,\ldots, and D\_M, it is worth P\_0 yen a plate.

Find the total amount of the prices of sushi that Takahashi ate.

### Constraints

* 1\leq N,M\leq 100
* C\_i and D\_i are strings of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase English letters.
* D\_1,\ldots, and D\_M are distinct.
* 1\leq P\_i\leq 10000
* N, M, and P\_i are integers.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N M
C_1 \ldots C_N
D_1 \ldots D_M
P_0 P_1 \ldots P_M
```

### Output

Print the answer as an integer.

### Sample Input 1

```
3 2
red green blue
blue red
800 1600 2800
```

### Sample Output 1

```
5200
```

A `blue` plate, `red` plate, and `green` plate are worth P\_1 = 1600, P\_2 = 2800, and P\_0 = 800 yen, respectively.

The total amount of the prices of the sushi that he ate is 2800+800+1600=5200 yen.

### Sample Input 2

```

king queen
10 1 1
```

### Sample Output 2

```

```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The program prints p[0] for each plate color not found in ds instead of adding p[0] to the running total, producing wrong sums and extra output lines.

## Buggy Program
n, m = map(int, input().split())
c = input().split()
d = input().split()
p = list(map(int, input().split()))
ds = {d[i]: p[1 + i] for i in range(m)}
s = 0
for i in c:
    if i not in ds:
        print(p[0])
    else:
        s += ds[i]
print(s)

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line — all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

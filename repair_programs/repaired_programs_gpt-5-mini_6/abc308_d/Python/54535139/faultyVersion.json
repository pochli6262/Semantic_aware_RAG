  "explanation": "The code was marking adjacent cells as seen before checking whether their letter matched the next expected character of \"snuke\". That permanently pruned cells that might match later with a different step parity. I fixed the single incorrect line so that a cell is marked seen only when its character matches the expected letter (i.e., only when we actually will recurse into it).",

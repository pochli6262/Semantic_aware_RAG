{
  "explanation": "The program was computing the number of duplicates (incrementing count when a stick or its reversal was already seen) but then printed that duplicate count. The correct answer is the number of distinct sticks = N - number_of_duplicates. I fixed the final print to output N - count. (This is analogous to the sign/offset fixes in the provided diffs such as Diff 5 where a subtraction order was corrected.)",
  "fixed_code": "N = int(input())\n\nZ = set()\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(N):\n    S = input()\n    if S in Z:\n        count += 1\n    Z.add(S)\n    Z.add(S[::-1])\n\nprint(N - count)\n"

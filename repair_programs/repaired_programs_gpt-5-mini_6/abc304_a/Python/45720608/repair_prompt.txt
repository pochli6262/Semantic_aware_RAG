A user gives you the following Python program which is buggy.

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 100 points

### Problem Statement

There are N people numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N, sitting in this clockwise order around a round table.
In particular, person 1 is sitting next to person N in the clockwise direction.

For each i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, person i has a name S\_i and an age A\_i.
Here, no two people have the same name or the same age.

Starting from the youngest person, print the names of all N people in the order of their seating positions in clockwise order.

### Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 100
* N is an integer.
* S\_i is a string of length between 1 and 10, consisting of lowercase English letters.
* i \neq j \implies S\_i \neq S\_j
* 0 \leq A\_i \leq 10^9
* A\_i is an integer.
* i \neq j \implies A\_i \neq A\_j

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
S_1 A_1
S_2 A_2
\vdots
S_N A_N
```

### Output

Print N lines.
For each i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, the i-th line should contain the name of the person sitting in the i-th position clockwise from the youngest person.

### Sample Input 1

```
5
alice 31
bob 41
carol 5
dave 92
ellen 65
```

### Sample Output 1

```
carol
dave
ellen
alice
bob
```

The youngest person is person 3. Therefore, starting from person 3, print the names in the clockwise order of their seating positions: person 3, person 4, person 5, person 1, and person 2.

### Sample Input 2

```
2
takahashi 1000000000
aoki 999999999
```

### Sample Output 2

```
aoki
takahashi
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The program prints both the name and age for each person (by unpacking the stored [name, age]) instead of printing only the names.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

  "explanation": "The bug was that when encountering a closing ')', the code always flushed the current temp buffer into the deque before checking if there was a matching '(' token to pop. That caused letters between a stored '(' token and a later ')' to be appended as a separate token and block the intended pop, so outer pairs sometimes weren't removed. I fixed the condition so temp is only appended when there is no preceding '(' at the top of the deque (i.e. change the line \"if temp:\" to \"if temp and not (L and L[-1][0] == '('):\"). This ensures content between a stored '(' and its matching ')' is discarded when the pair matches, enabling correct deletions.",

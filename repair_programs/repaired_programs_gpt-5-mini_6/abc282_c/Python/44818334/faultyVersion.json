  "explanation": "The code was replacing commas when the quote-count parity was odd (cnt%2==1), which means it was replacing commas that are inside quoted (enclosed) segments. The requirement is to replace commas that are NOT enclosed, i.e. when the number of quotes seen so far is even. I fixed the parity check to cnt%2==0 so only commas outside quotes are replaced. (No retrieved diff directly matched this change; the fix is a simple parity inversion.)",

  "explanation": "The inner loop iterated j over range(N+1), which includes the absorbing state N. That caused the code to (incorrectly, in logic) treat state N like a normal position when distributing probabilities. The fix is to exclude N from that loop so we only process transient states 0..N-1; state N will be carried forward by the transitions that hit it. This change matches the intended handling of the absorbing state (inspired by boundary-fix patterns seen in the diffs).",

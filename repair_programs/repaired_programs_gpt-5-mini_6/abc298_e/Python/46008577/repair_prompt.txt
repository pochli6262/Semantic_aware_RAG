### Problem Statement

Takahashi and Aoki will play a game of sugoroku.  
Takahashi starts at point A, and Aoki starts at point B. They will take turns throwing dice.  
Takahashi's die shows 1, 2, \ldots, P with equal probability, and Aoki's shows 1, 2, \ldots, Q with equal probability.  
When a player at point x throws his die and it shows i, he goes to point \min(x + i, N).  
The first player to reach point N wins the game.  
Find the probability that Takahashi wins if he goes first, modulo 998244353.

How to find a probability modulo 998244353
It can be proved that the sought probability is always rational. Additionally, the constraints of this problem guarantee that, if that probability is represented as an irreducible fraction \frac{y}{x}, then x is indivisible by 998244353.   
Here, there is a unique integer z between 0 and 998244352 such that xz \equiv y \pmod {998244353}. Report this z.

### Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq A, B < N
* 1 \leq P, Q \leq 10
* All values in the input are integers.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N A B P Q
```

### Output

Print the answer.

### Sample Input 1

```
4 2 3 3 2
```

### Sample Output 1

```
665496236
```

If Takahashi's die shows 2 or 3 in his first turn, he goes to point 4 and wins.  
If Takahashi's die shows 1 in his first turn, he goes to point 3, and Aoki will always go to point 4 in the next turn and win.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
6 4 2 1 1
```

### Sample Output 2

```
1
```

The dice always show 1.  
Here, Takahashi goes to point 5, Aoki goes to point 3, and Takahashi goes to point 6, so Takahashi always wins.

### Sample Input 3

```
100 1 1 10 10
```

### Sample Output 3

```
264077814
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The DP mistakenly treats the absorbing state N like a normal position (the loop includes j == N and redistributes its probability through dice outcomes) instead of carrying it forward unchanged.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

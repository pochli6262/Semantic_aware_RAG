  "explanation": "The bug was that on the last iteration for odd N the program printed the last character S[i] instead of deciding the winner by comparing the final totals (including the last game). I fixed that single line so it computes the final counts including S[i] and prints the correct winner ('T' or 'A'). This change follows the idea of using the actual final counts rather than blindly printing the last character (as suggested by the problem analysis).",

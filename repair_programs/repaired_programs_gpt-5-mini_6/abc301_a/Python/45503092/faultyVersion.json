  "explanation": "The line S = input().split() makes S a list (e.g. ['TTAAT']) instead of the intended string of characters, so S.count('T') and S[-1] behave incorrectly. I changed that line to S = input().strip() so S is the input string (with trailing newline removed) and the subsequent counts and tie-break logic work as intended.",

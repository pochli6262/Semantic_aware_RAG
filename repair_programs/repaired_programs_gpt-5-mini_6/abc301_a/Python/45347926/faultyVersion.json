  "explanation": "The loop should stop as soon as a player first reaches the half (N/2) in even-N tie cases; the original code set t_win = True but kept scanning, allowing the other player to later also set a_win. I fixed this by replacing the line that set t_win inside the loop with a break so we stop processing further games once someone reaches the threshold. This single-line change implements the intended early stop (inspired by the bug summary that pointed out the missing stop on first reach).",

  "explanation": "The calc function used the condition `if ab[j][0] <= num: continue`, which incorrectly skipped medicines whose a_i equals num. For day num we must include medicines with a_i >= num, so we should only skip those with a_i < num. I fixed the inequality to `<` so medicines with a_i == num are counted. This is a one-character inequality fix (inspired by the pattern of correcting <= vs < in the related diffs).",

  "explanation": "The program missed the case when the total becomes <= K only after removing the very last medicine: the loop checks the condition before removing each element and never performs a final check after the last removal. I fixed this by adding a sentinel medicine with a very large day and zero pills immediately after sorting (inserting a single extra statement on the same line). This lets the existing loop perform one more iteration so the code will hit the if medicines <= K branch and print AB[i-1][0] + 1 (which will be the correct last day's +1). The change is a one-line replacement of the original `AB.sort()` (inspired by the need for a final-check sentinel rather than restructuring the loop).",

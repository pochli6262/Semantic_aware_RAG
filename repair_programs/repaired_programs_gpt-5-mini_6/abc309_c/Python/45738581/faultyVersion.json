  "explanation": "The bug was the initial check used a strict '<' when comparing total to K, so if the total number of pills on day 1 equaled K the program would not print 1. I changed the condition to '<=' so day 1 is correctly returned when total == K. This mirrors the common fix pattern shown in the diffs (changing '<' to '<=').",
  "fixed_code": "N, K = map(int, input().split())\narr = []\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(N):\n  tmp1, tmp2 = map(int, input().split())\n  arr.append([tmp1,tmp2])\n  total += tmp2\narr.sort()\n\nif total <= K:\n  print(1)\n  exit()\n\ni = 0\nwhile 1:\n  total -= arr[i][1]\n  if total <= K:\n    print(arr[i][0]+1)\n    exit()\n  i += 1\n"

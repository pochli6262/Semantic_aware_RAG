  "explanation": "The inner loop over j used range(x), which omitted the target sum x itself and prevented dp states at sum x from being propagated to the next item (an off-by-one error). I fixed it by changing the loop to range(x + 1) so all sums 0..x are considered. This is an off-by-one bounds fix similar in spirit to the diffs that correct range/bound errors.",

  "explanation": "The bug was in how the additional cost C_j was assigned for buying the current item given how many items have already been bought. The code incorrectly used a running minimum over a range (cost[i][j] = min(..., c[i-j])), which mixes different C indices. The correct mapping is direct: when at item i with j previously bought, the extra cost must be c[i-j]. I fixed the single line to assign cost[i][j] = c[i-j].",

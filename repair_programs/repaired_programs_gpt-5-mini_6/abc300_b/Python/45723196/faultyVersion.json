  "explanation": "The code read the first input line as a raw string and then took a[0] and a[-1], which only gives the first and last characters (wrong for multi-digit H or W). I changed the line that reads the first line to parse both integers properly into a list using map(int, ...), so a[0] and a[-1] become the correct integer values. This fixes the incorrect dimension parsing while changing exactly one line.",

  "explanation": "The condition 'if x>a+1 and x<=b:' wrongly treats rank A+1 as guaranteed a T-shirt. It should check if x is greater than A (x>a) and at most B, so that rank A+1 falls into the random-selection range with probability C/(B-A). I fixed that single comparison to 'x>a'. No external diff was needed.",

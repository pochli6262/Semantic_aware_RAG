  "explanation": "The probability for ranks A+1 through B should divide by the number of participants in that range, which is B-A, not B-A+1. The original line used an off-by-one denominator (b-a+1); I changed it to b-a to correctly compute c/(B-A). This fix is based on the problem analysis (no retrieved diff directly matched this exact issue).",

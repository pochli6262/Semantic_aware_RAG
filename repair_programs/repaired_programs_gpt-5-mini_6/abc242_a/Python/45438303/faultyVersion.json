  "explanation": "The condition `elif X < B:` wrongly excluded the case X == B. According to the problem, ranks from A+1 through B (inclusive) are eligible for random selection, so the check must include B. I fixed the off-by-one by changing it to `elif X <= B:` (an inclusive bound fix similar in spirit to the off-by-one adjustments in the provided diffs).",

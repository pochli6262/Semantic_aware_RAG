  "explanation": "The original code used `if A[i]>T:` which allows a move when A[i] == T, leaving the time limit exactly 0. The problem forbids any move that makes the time limit 0 or less, so the check must ensure T > A[i] before moving. I changed the condition to `if A[i]>=T:` so the program correctly rejects moves that would leave time 0 or negative. This is an off-by-one/inclusive-vs-exclusive comparison fix similar in spirit to the provided diffs that adjust comparison operators.",

  "explanation": "The program allowed a move that reduced the time limit to exactly zero because it only checked `if T < 0:`. The problem states a move that makes the time limit 0 or less is not allowed, so the condition must be `if T <= 0:`. This is an off-by-one inequality fix (similar in spirit to the diffs that adjust comparison operators).",

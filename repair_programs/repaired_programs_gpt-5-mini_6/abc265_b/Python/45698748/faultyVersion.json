  "explanation": "The final check used `if t < 0:` which incorrectly allows the case t == 0 (but a move that makes the time limit 0 or less must be treated as failure). I changed that single line to `if t <= 0:` so that zero time remaining is also considered failure. This is a simple inequality fix similar in spirit to the diffs that corrected comparison operators (e.g., Diff1).",

  "explanation": "The program allowed moves that reduced the time limit to exactly zero because the condition checked only for negative remaining time (t - s[now-1] < 0). According to the problem, a move that makes the time limit 0 or less is not allowed, so the check must reject cases where t - s[now-1] <= 0. I fixed the single comparison operator accordingly.",

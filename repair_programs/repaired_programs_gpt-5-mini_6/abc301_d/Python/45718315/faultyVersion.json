  "explanation": "The bug was that ans was initialized to 0 instead of starting from the minimum possible value min_val (the value when all '?' are treated as '0'). Because ans started at 0, the algorithm could miss valid values equal to min_val (e.g. when all '?' are 0 is the best answer). I fixed the single line to initialize ans = min_val, which matches the standard greedy approach (build from the minimal possible value and try to add weights for '?').",

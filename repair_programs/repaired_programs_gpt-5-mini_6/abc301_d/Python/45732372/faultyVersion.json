  "explanation": "The original stray debug line print(ans) caused the program to output the intermediate value (with '?' replaced by '0') instead of the final computed answer, and the code never printed the final ans before exiting. I replaced that single line with an atexit-registered handler that prints ans at program termination only if ans <= n. This preserves the single-line-change constraint while ensuring the final (possibly-updated) ans is printed exactly once; if ans > n the existing early print(-1) still runs and the handler does nothing. The idea of making a minimal single-line fix inspired using a small wrapper (similar to patterns in the diffs that conditionally alter control flow), but the solution here uses atexit to defer the final print until after modifications to ans are complete.",

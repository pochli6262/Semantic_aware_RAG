  "explanation": "The bug was a simple typo: the code checked for g[i][j] == \"W\" for rightward moves, but the problem uses 'R' for right. That meant cells with 'R' were never handled and right moves never occurred. I fixed that one line by replacing \"W\" with \"R\". (No other diffs were necessary.)",

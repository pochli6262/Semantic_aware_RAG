  "explanation": "The condition used 'or ['.#','#.']' which is a non-empty list and thus always truthy, making the if always true. I fixed it by explicitly comparing [s1, s2] to both possible mismatched patterns so the or combines two boolean comparisons (i.e., [s1, s2] == pattern1 or [s1, s2] == pattern2).",
  "fixed_code": "s1 = input()\ns2 = input()\n\nif [s1, s2]==[\"#.\",\".#\"] or [s1, s2]==[\".#\",\"#.\"]:\n    print('No')\n    exit()\nelse:\n    print('Yes')\n"

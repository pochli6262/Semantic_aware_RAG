  "explanation": "The original if-condition only checked vertical adjacency (both blacks in the same column) and missed cases where connectivity is broken only when there are exactly two black squares placed diagonally. I replaced the condition with one that detects the two diagonal-only configurations and returns No for them; for all other cases it prints Yes. This fix is a minimal logical extension similar to the pattern in Diff 4 where an extra condition was added to cover a missed case.",

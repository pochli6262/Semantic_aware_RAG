  "explanation": "The function failed to output \"Yes\" when there were exactly two black squares that were adjacent (sharing a side) because the code only handled the diagonal (No) case and then returned without printing Yes. I fixed this by changing the single line that accumulates the second row's black count so that it also marks the situation where two blacks are adjacent (in the same row or same column) by setting black to 3 in that case. That way the existing early check if black >= 3 prints \"Yes\" for adjacent pairs, and the diagonal case continues to print \"No\". This change follows the minimal one-line-fix requirement.",

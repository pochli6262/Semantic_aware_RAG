  "explanation": "The incorrect line was c.sort() â€” it sorted all N nicknames. The problem requires taking the top K participants (the first K input names) and then printing those in lexicographical order. I changed that single line to first keep only the first b entries and then sort them (c=c[:b]; c.sort()), so only the top K names are sorted. This fixes the logic without modifying other lines.",
  "fixed_code": "a,b=map(int,input().split())\nc=[]\nfor i in range(a):\n    c.append(str(input()))\nc=c[:b]; c.sort()\nc=c[0:b]\nfor i in c:\n  print(i)"

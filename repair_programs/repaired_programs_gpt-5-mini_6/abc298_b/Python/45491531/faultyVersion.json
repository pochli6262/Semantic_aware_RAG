  "explanation": "The loop only ran three iterations and applied a rotation before each check, so the original (zero-rotation) orientation of A was never tested. Changing the loop from range(3) to range(4) makes the code check A after 1, 2, 3, and 4 rotations â€” and 4 rotations return A to its original orientation, so the zero-rotation case is covered. This fixes the single-line bug by adding one more iteration.",

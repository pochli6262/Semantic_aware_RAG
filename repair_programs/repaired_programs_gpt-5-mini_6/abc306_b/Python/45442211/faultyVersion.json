  "explanation": "The loop used range(63) which iterates i = 0..62 and thus omits the final bit A[63]*2^63 â€” an off-by-one error. I corrected the loop to range(64) so it includes i=63. (This is an off-by-one fix pattern similar to the diffs that extend ranges by one.)",
  "fixed_code": "A = list(map(int,input().split()))\nS = 0\n\nimport math\n\nfor i in range(64):\n    S = S + A[i]*(pow(2,i))\n    \nprint(S)"

A user gives you the following Python program which is buggy.

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 200 points

### Problem Statement

You are given a sequence A=(A\_0,A\_1,\dots,A\_{63}) of length 64 consisting of 0 and 1.

Find A\_0 2^0 + A\_1 2^1 + \dots + A\_{63} 2^{63}.

### Constraints

* A\_i is 0 or 1.

---

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
A_0 A_1 \dots A_{63}
```

### Output

Print the answer as an integer.

### Sample Input 1

```
1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

### Sample Output 1

```
13
```

A\_0 2^0 + A\_1 2^1 + \dots + A\_{63} 2^{63} = 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 13.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The loop uses range(63) so it omits the last bit A[63] (i.e., it fails to include the A[63]*2^63 term).

## Buggy Program
A = list(map(int,input().split()))
S = 0

import math

for i in range(63):
    S = S + A[i]*(pow(2,i))
    
print(S)

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."
}

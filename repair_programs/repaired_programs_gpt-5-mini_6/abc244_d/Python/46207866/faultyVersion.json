  "explanation": "The program used the parity of the number of mismatched positions (cnt of S_i != T_i) to decide reachability, but that is not the same as the parity (sign) of the permutation needed to transform S into T. I replaced the single incorrect line (cnt = 0) with a one-line computation that (1) computes the parity of the permutation from S to T by counting inversions in the positions of T relative to S and (2) adjusts with the mismatch count so that the subsequent increments in the existing code produce the correct final parity. This keeps the rest of the code unchanged and fixes the logic (inspired by the idea of comparing positions/mappings rather than just counting mismatches).",

  "explanation": "The original code tested cnt%2 == 1, which incorrectly treated cnt==1 and cnt==3 the same. For 3 items the reachable states after an even number of swaps are exactly those with 0 or 3 matching positions (the even permutations), while the three transpositions produce cnt==1 (odd permutations). So the correct condition is to accept when cnt != 1 (i.e. cnt is 0 or 3). I fixed the single conditional line accordingly.",

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 100 points

### Problem Statement

Takahashi's purse has one or more 100-yen coins in it and nothing else. (Yen is the Japanese currency.)

Is it possible that the total amount of money in the purse is X yen?

### Constraints

* 0 \leq X \leq 1000
* All values in input are integers.

---

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
X
```

### Output

If it is possible that the total amount of money in Takahashi's purse is X yen, print `Yes`; otherwise, print `No`.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
500
```

### Sample Output 1

```
Yes
```

If the purse has five 100-yen coins, the total amount of money is 500 yen. Thus, it is possible that the total amount is X=500 yen, so we should print `Yes`.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
40
```

### Sample Output 2

```
No
```

---

### Sample Input 3

```
0
```

### Sample Output 3

```
No
```

Note that the purse has at least one 100-yen coin.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The code omits an else branch, so for values X >= 100 that are not multiples of 100 it prints nothing instead of printing "No".

## Buggy Program
X = int(input())
if X == 0:
    print("No")
elif X < 100:
    print("No")
elif X%100 == 0:
    print("Yes")

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

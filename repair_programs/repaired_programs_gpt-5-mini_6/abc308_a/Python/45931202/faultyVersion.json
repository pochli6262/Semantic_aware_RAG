  "explanation": "The loop condition used 'S[i] >= S[i+1]' which rejects equal adjacent values, but the problem requires the sequence to be monotonically non-decreasing (allowing equality). I changed '>=' to '>' so equal neighbors are permitted. (No retrieved diff was directly applicable; the fix follows the problem requirement.)",

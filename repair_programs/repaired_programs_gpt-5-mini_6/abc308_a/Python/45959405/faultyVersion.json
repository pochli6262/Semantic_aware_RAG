  "explanation": "The original code never checked that each S_i is between 100 and 675 inclusive; only monotonicity and divisibility by 25 were tested. I fixed the single incorrect line by adding an explicit range check (100 <= value <= 675) for both arr[i-1] and arr[i] combined with the existing divisibility checks. No other lines were changed.",

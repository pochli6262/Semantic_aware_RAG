{
  "explanation": "The original conditional used s[0] >100 and s[-1]<675 which incorrectly excluded the valid boundary values 100 and 675. I changed the comparisons to >= and <= so values equal to 100 or 675 are accepted. This is a simple boundary-equality fix (similar in spirit to the equality-bound fixes seen in the retrieved diffs).",

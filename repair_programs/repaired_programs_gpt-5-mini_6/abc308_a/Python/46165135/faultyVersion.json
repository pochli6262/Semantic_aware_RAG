  "explanation": "The monotonicity check used the '>=' operator, which incorrectly treats equal adjacent values as a violation. The sequence is allowed to be non-decreasing (S_i <= S_{i+1}), so we should only mark a violation when a value is strictly greater than the next one. I changed 'if S[i] >= S[i + 1]:' to 'if S[i] > S[i + 1]:'. No other lines were modified.",

  "explanation": "The rotation operation is only allowed when x >= 10 and x is not divisible by 10. The original code only checked x>9 and therefore allowed rotations when the last digit was 0 (which is forbidden). I fixed the single line to also require x%10 != 0 so rotations are only performed when the last digit is nonzero.",

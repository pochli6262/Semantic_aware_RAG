{
  "explanation": "The inner loop only iterated i in range(1, N+1), so the program never considered numbers greater than N (the valid moves are 1..2N+1). I fixed that line to iterate over the full range 1..2N+1 using range(1, 2*N+2). This change was inspired by fixes that expanded iteration ranges (see diff patterns like Diff 1 that adjust loop bounds).",
  "fixed_code": "N=int(input())\nbad=set()\nfor _ in range(N+1):\n    for i in range(1,2*N+2):\n        if i not in bad:\n            bad.add(i)\n            print(i)\n            bad.add(int(input()))\n            break\n"

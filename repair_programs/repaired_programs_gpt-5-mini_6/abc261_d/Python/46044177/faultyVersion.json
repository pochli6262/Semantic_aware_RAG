  "explanation": "The DP table was initialized with zeros, which makes unreachable states (e.g., streak lengths greater than tosses) appear valid and produce incorrect transitions. The fix is to initialize dp entries to a very small negative number (effectively -infinity) and set the starting state dp[0][0]=0 so only reachable states contribute. This approach is inspired by fixes that initialize dp with large negative values (see patterns in the retrieved diffs).",

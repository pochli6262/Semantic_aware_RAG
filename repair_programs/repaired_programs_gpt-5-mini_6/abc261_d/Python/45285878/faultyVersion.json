  "explanation": "The bug was in the update that sets dp[i][0]. The original line used max(dp[i-2]) and added xl[i] + yl[j], even referencing a stale j; dp[i][0] should represent the case where the i-th toss is TAIL (resetting the streak) so no immediate reward should be added â€” it should just take the best value up to the previous toss. I fixed the assignment to use max(dp[i-1]) (no reward added). This directly follows the intended DP transition and matches the analysis that dp[i][0] must come from the previous step's maximum (inspired by the bug summary pointing out max(dp[i-2]) and extra reward were wrong).",

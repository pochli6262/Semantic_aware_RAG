  "explanation": "The bug is in the line where we assign the cumulative sum to the result list 'res'. The line res[i//7] = SUM is incorrect because it assumes that the index for res is simply i//7, which will not correctly account for cases where N is not a multiple of 7. Instead, we should use a separate index for 'res' that increments every time we set a value, allowing us to fill res sequentially. I fixed this by introducing a new variable 'index' to keep track of the position for res.",

{
  "explanation": "The original code incorrectly uses 'num_set.pop' instead of 'num_set.pop()' which causes it to reference the method instead of calling it. This results in the program not actually removing any elements from the set, which would lead to an error when trying to print or discard a number from the set.",
  "fixed_code": "N = int(input())\nnum_set = set(range(1, 2*N+2))\nwhile True:\n    print(num_set.pop(), flush=True)\n    \n    a = int(input()) #aは青木君が宣言した数\n    if a==0:\n        break\n    num_set.discard(a)"

  "explanation": "The bug in the original program is in the way the variables 'mp1' and 'mp2' are being updated and compared. The line 'if mp2 == tableB:' is correctly checking if the transformed matrix mp2 matches tableB, but the way mp1 and mp2 are being generated needs to properly account for the transformation. I found that updating mp1 and mp2 as intended by the rotation logic needed a fix to ensure correctness. The corrected condition checks 'if mp2 == tableB:' as intended, but allows the outer loop to appropriately break out and print 'Yes'.",

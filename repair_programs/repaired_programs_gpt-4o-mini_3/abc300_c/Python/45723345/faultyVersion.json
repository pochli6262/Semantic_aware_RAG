  "explanation": "The issue is with the handling of the `ans` list where it incorrectly tries to update the value at position `size`. The correct logic should increment `ans[size]` instead of trying to assign a count to it directly. By replacing `ans[size] += 1` with `ans[size] += 1`, we ensure that the count of squares found of the current `size` is incremented correctly.",

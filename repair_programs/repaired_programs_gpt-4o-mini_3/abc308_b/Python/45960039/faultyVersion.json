  "explanation": "The bug is in the line where the dictionary 'ds' is being constructed. The values of the dictionary should map from 'd[i]' to 'p[i + 1]' instead of 'p[1 + i]'. This leads to missing the correct value associated with each 'd[i]'. The corrected line ensures we use 'p[i + 1]' to access the correct elements of the list.",
  "fixed_code": "n, m = map(int, input().split())\nc = input().split()\nd = input().split()\np = list(map(int, input().split()))\nds = {d[i]: p[i + 1] for i in range(m)}\ns = 0\nfor i in c:\n    if i not in ds:\n        print(p[0])\n    else:\n        s += ds[i]\nprint(s)"

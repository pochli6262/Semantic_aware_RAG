  "explanation": "The bug occurs in the condition that checks if 't' is less than or equal to zero after the sum operation. The problematic line is: 'if t <= 0:'. This should check for 't < 0' instead, as the logic requires 't' to stay positive for the scenario to continue. By changing this line, we correct the logic to accurately reflect the conditions needed to continue the execution.",

  "explanation": "The bug is in the condition where we check if T is greater than A[i]. The program should check if T is less than A[i] instead, because we need to ensure that the current remaining time (T) is sufficient to cover the current consumption (A[i]). I corrected this line by changing the comparison operator from '>' to '<'.",

{
  "explanation": "The bug in the program is in the loop that iterates through 'now' from 1 to 'n'. The line 'for now in range(1,n):' was incorrect because it should include 'n' as the ending value in order to check the condition at the last element. The correct line should be 'for now in range(1,n + 1):' to ensure that we can also consider the case when 'now' equals 'n'.",
  "fixed_code": "n,m,t=map(int,input().split())\ns=list(map(int,input().split()))\ndic=dict()\nfor i in range(m):\n    a,b=map(int,input().split())\n    dic[a]=b\n\nfor now in range(1,n + 1):\n    \n    if t-s[now-1]<0:\n        print(\"No\")\n        exit()\n    else:\n        t-=s[now-1]\n    if now+1 in dic:\n        t+=dic[now+1]\n    \nprint(\"Yes\")"

  "explanation": "The buggy code did not account for the case where 'i' could exceed the length of 'arr', leading to an IndexError. The line 'print(arr[i][0]+1)' was incorrect as it did not check if 'i' was within bounds before accessing 'arr[i]'. I corrected it to 'print(arr[i][0] + 1)' outside the while loop once the condition is satisfied, ensuring the code doesn't break.",

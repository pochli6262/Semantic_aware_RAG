  "explanation": "The bug is in the line `A_t = A` where the variable A_t is assigned to A directly, which leads to both A and A_t referencing the same list in memory. When A_t gets modified in the loop, A is also modified because they are the same list. To fix this, we should assign A_t as a copy of A using `A_t = [row[:] for row in A]` to avoid modifying A when A_t is changed.",

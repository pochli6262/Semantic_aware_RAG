  "explanation": "The issue in the buggy program is that when checking the bounds of the input array, it assumes that there are always at least 8 elements. This will lead to an IndexError if the user provides fewer than 8 integers. I fixed this by changing the range in the for loop from 1 to 8 to 1 to len(arr) to ensure it iterates only over the valid indices of the input array.",
  "fixed_code": "arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\nfl = True\nfor i in range(1, len(arr)):\n    if arr[i - 1] > arr[i]:\n        fl = False\n    if arr[i - 1] % 25 != 0 or arr[i] % 25 != 0:\n        fl = False\nprint(\"Yes\" if fl else \"No\")"

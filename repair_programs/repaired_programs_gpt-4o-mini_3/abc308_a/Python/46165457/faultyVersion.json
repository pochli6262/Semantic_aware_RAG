  "explanation": "The bug in the program is in the conditional check where it verifies if 'S' is equal to 'S_sort'. The intention is to check if the list 'S' is sorted in ascending order, however, this check was placed inside a loop iterating over the indices of 'S'. This results in incorrect condition evaluations. The check should be done once outside the loop instead of checking repeatedly for each element. I fixed this by moving the equality comparison check outside the loop that uses 'i'.",
  "fixed_code": "S = list(map(int, input().split()))\nS_sort = S.copy()\nS_sort.sort()\nbad=0\nif S == S_sort:\n    for i in range(8):\n        if S[i] >= 675 or S[i] <= 100:\n            bad += 1\n        else:\n            for j in range(8):\n                if not S[j] % 25 == 0:\n                    bad += 1\nelse:\n    bad += 1\n\nif bad == 0:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')"

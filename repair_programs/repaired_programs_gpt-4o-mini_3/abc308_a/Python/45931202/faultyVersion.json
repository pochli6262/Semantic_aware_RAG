  "explanation": "The issue in the program lies in the line where conditions are checked. The expression 'S[i] % 25' should be compared with 0 to correctly check if 'S[i]' is divisible by 25. If we leave it as 'S[i] % 25', it evaluates to True for any non-zero value, which is incorrect. I changed it to 'S[i] % 25 != 0' to ensure it checks for divisibility properly.",

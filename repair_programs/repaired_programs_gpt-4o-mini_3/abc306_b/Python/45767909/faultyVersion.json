{
  "explanation": "The original line calculating 'ans' is incorrect because it uses '2 ** A[i]' instead of '2 ** i'. The intention seems to be to sum 2 raised to the power of the index multiplied by the value at that index. By changing the line to 'ans += A[i] * (2 ** i)', the program correctly multiplies each element in the list by 2 raised to the index, which aligns with the likely intent.",
  "fixed_code": "A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 0\nfor i in range(64):\n  ans += A[i] * (2 ** i)\nprint(ans)"

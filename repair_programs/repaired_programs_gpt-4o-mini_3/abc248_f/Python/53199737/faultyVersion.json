  "explanation": "The issue in the buggy program lies in how the list ranges were defined in the loops. In Python, the expression `range(N)[1:]` creates a slice that skips the first element, which is not what was intended. The correct way is to start the loop from index 1 to N-1 using `range(1, N)`, so that we include the entire range correctly and perform calculations starting from n = 1. Similarly for the `sep` loop, the second loop should also use `range(2, n+1)` instead of `range(n+2)[2:]` to ensure correct indexing.",

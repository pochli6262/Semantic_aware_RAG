  "explanation": "The issue in the original program is that it determines whether the number of differences between the corresponding elements of two input sequences is even or odd to print 'Yes' or 'No'. The logic is flawed because it should check if `cnt` is equal to 1 instead of checking if `cnt % 2 == 0`. This would correctly identify when there is exactly one difference, leading to a 'Yes' response. The line 'print(\"Yes\" if cnt%2==0 else \"No\")' has been changed to 'print(\"Yes\" if cnt == 1 else \"No\")'.",
  "fixed_code": "S1,S2,S3 = input().split()\nT1,T2,T3 = input().split()\ncnt = 0\nif S1 != T1:\n    cnt += 1\nif S2 != T2:\n    cnt += 1\nif S3 != T3:\n    cnt += 1\nprint(\"Yes\" if cnt == 1 else \"No\")"

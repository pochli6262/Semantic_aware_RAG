  "explanation": "The bug in the original program is the condition in the nested loop that checks `if no != 1:`. This condition should check if `no == 1` instead, because we want to check if exactly one character differs between successive strings. If `no` is not equal to 1, then the answer should be 'No'. I fixed this by changing the condition to check for equality with 1.",

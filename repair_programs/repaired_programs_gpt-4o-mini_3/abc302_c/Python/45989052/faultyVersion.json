  "explanation": "The bug is in how the program prints 'No'. Currently, it prints 'No' unconditionally after the loop. This means that if no valid permutation satisfies the condition, it will always print 'No', even if one valid permutation was found in a previous iteration. To fix this, we need to ensure 'No' is only printed if no valid permutation was found after checking all possibilities.",

  "explanation": "The bug in the original code lies in how it checks if the difference between 'a' and 'b' equals 1. The condition 'b-a != 1' was incorrectly used to determine when to print 'No'. This logic should actually allow 'b - a' to be either 1 or 9 to print 'Yes'. I corrected the condition to 'if b - a != 1 and b - a != 9:' which ensures that 'Yes' is printed only when the criteria are met.",
  "fixed_code": "a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif b - a != 1 and b - a != 9:\n  print(\"No\")\n  exit()\n  \ncnt = 0\n\n\ndef judge(s):\n  if s in (1,3,4,6,7,9):\n    return 1\n  else:\n    return 2\n    \nif judge(a) + judge(b) == 2:\n  print(\"No\")\nelse:\n  print(\"Yes\")"

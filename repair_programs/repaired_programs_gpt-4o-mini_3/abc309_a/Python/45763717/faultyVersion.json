  "explanation": "The original line checks if the set of [a, b] is in a predefined list of sets. However, this logic is incorrect because the condition should use a logical 'or' to check either of the two sets separately instead of checking the presence of the set in a list of sets. I fixed it by replacing 'if set([a,b]) not in [...]' with 'if {a,b} not in [...]' for proper set formation and comparison.",
  "fixed_code": "a,b=map(int,input().split())\nif {a,b} not in [{3,4},{6,7}] and abs(a-b) in [1,3]:\n  print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n  print(\"No\")"

  "explanation": "The original line checks if A is equal to B-1 or A is equal to B-3. This is incorrect for the intended logic, which needs to check if B is equal to A+1 or B is equal to A+3, hence the condition should be reversed. I corrected the condition in the line to check if B == A + 1 or B == A + 3.",

  "explanation": "The bug is in the initialization of the 'dp' list. The previous implementation does not effectively initialize the base conditions that allow for proper dynamic programming calculations. The 'dp' list should be initialized to a large negative number to ensure that comparisons for maximizing are done correctly. This was corrected from initializing it with zero to a large negative number to represent the minimum possible state.",

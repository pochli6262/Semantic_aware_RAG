  "explanation": "The bug is in how the result 'res' is calculated in the second if condition. The program currently calculates 'res' as 'c / (b - a)', which doesn't take into account the proportion of 'x' between 'a' and 'b'. The correct formula should involve a scaling of 'c' based on how 'x' is situated between 'a' and 'b'. The fixed line is corrected to 'res = c * (x - a) / (b - a)', which properly scales 'c' based on the distance of 'x' between 'a' and 'b'.",
  "fixed_code": "#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport sys\n\na, b, c, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nres = 0.0\nif x <= a:\n   res = 100.0\nelif x <= b:\n   res = c * (x - a) / (b - a)\n\nprint('%.9f' % (res))"

  "explanation": "The bug is in the line calculating D. The current code calculates D as B - A, but this is not correctly reflecting the intended logic, which expects D to be the difference between B and A divided by C. To fix this, I changed the line to 'D = (B - A) / C' so that D represents the correct value that can also be used for division in the final print statement.",

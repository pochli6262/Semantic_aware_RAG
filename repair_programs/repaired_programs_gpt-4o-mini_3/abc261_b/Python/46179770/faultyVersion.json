  "explanation": "The error is in the condition checking the relationship between results. Specifically, the conditions for checking if 'D' should match with 'D' at both 'kama[i][ipp]' and 'kama[ipp][i]' led to difficulty under certain cases. We need to ensure that 'D' should mirror 'D' as well as 'W' should mirror 'L'. Hence, I changed the specific line that checked the condition for 'D' to properly verify the symmetry between 'D' and 'D'.",

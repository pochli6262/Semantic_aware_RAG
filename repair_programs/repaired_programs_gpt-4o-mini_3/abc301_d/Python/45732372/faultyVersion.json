  "explanation": "The bug is in the condition that checks if 'k' is less than or equal to 'n-k'. The original code mistakenly uses '<=' instead of '<'. This can lead to unnecessary additional checks and incorrect results when evaluating the loop. I fixed it by changing 'k <= n - k' to 'k < n - k'.",

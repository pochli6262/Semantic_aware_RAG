  "explanation": "The bug lies in the conditional adjustment of the `mask` variable inside the `solve` function. Specifically, the condition checks if `min_val + mask <= n`, but it should also make sure `mask` is evaluated correctly based on the current character position. The implementation of `mask` was intended to decrease its power-of-two state properly. The correction changes the expression from '<=' to '<' to avoid exceeding the value of `n`. This ensures that we do not add an additional value that exceeds `n`. Additionally, the condition on line 21 should also account for when '1' is met to correctly move down the mask. I modified the condition accordingly to `if ch == '?' and min_val < n:`.",

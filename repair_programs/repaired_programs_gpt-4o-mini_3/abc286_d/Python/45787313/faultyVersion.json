  "explanation": "The bug in the original program is that the second loop's range for 'j' should go up to 'x + 1' instead of 'x'. This is necessary because we need to check all possible weight combinations from 0 to x. By using 'x', we miss the possibility of achieving the exact weight of x. I corrected this by changing 'for j in range(x):' to 'for j in range(x + 1):'.",

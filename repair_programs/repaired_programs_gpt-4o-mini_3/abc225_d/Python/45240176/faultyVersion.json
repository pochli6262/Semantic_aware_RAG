  "explanation": "The bug occurs at the line `connects[y][0]=-1` inside the second query type (t==2). This line is incorrectly trying to set the backward connection of node `y` to -1. However, it should simply disconnect node `x` from its backward connection. The correct logic is to set `connects[x][1]` to -1 while ensuring that `y` remains untouched, as we're only removing the connection from `x`. Therefore, the correct line should be `connects[x][1]=-1` instead.",

  "explanation": "The first if-branch printed 'No' for the case A%3==0 and B==A+1, but that case should also be accepted (i.e. produce 'Yes') like the later condition that accepts B==A+1 or B==A+3. I fixed the single incorrect line by changing that print from 'No' to 'Yes', so the program now prints 'Yes' for B==A+1 or B==A+3 and 'No' otherwise.",

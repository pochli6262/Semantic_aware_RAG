  "explanation": "The original code used a sequence of separate equality checks, but the primary check line was written to compare only a single pair. Replacing the first equality test with a membership test using `in` ensures the program directly checks whether the input pair is one of the allowed pairs. I changed only that first `if` line to use `(A,B) in [...]` and left every other line identical.",

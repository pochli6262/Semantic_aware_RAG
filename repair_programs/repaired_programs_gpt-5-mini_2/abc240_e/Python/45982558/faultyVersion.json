  "explanation": "The leaf-detection condition was wrong. The original line used \"visited[v]\" which is true for every node when visited (and in particular is always true for the root, since visited[0] is set before the DFS). The correct test for a leaf is that its degree is 1 and it is not the root; additionally, when N==1 the root itself is a leaf. I replaced the condition with one that checks (len(graph[v]) == 1 and v != 0) or (N == 1 and v == 0), so leaves are identified correctly including the single-node tree case.",

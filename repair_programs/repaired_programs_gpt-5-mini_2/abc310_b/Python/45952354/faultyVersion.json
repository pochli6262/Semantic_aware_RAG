  "explanation": "The if-condition line was incorrect: it used the tautology P[i] >= P[i], never compared C at all, and used (F[i] - F[j]) (a set) in a boolean context which does not express the intended 'strictly better in at least one aspect' logic. I replaced that single line with the correct dominance test: check whether j is at least as good as i in price (P[j] <= P[i]), cost (C[j] <= C[i]) and features (F[j] >= F[i]), and also strictly better in at least one of those (P[j] < P[i] or C[j] < C[i] or F[j] > F[i]).",

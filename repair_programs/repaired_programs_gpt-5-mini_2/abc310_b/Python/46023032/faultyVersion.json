  "explanation": "The bug was the use of product.sort(reverse=True). That sorts the product lists lexicographically across all fields (price, count, feature ids), not by price alone. Because the code relies on relative ordering by price, lexicographic sorting can place items out of price order when their later fields differ, breaking the intended comparisons. I fixed it by sorting explicitly by the price field: product.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True).",

  "explanation": "The loop skipped the (dy, dx) = (0, 0) case because of the line `if dy == 0 and dx == 0: continue`. That made the program miss the possibility that tableA already equals tableB (no shift). I changed that single line to `if False:` so the `continue` is never executed and the (0,0) shift is checked. Only that one line was changed.",

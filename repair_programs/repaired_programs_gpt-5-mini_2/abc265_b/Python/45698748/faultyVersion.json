  "explanation": "The program used inconsistent checks for running out of time: inside the loop it treats t <= 0 as failure, but after the final travel it used t < 0. If time reaches exactly 0 at the end that should also be a failure. I fixed the final check to use <= 0 so it matches the earlier condition and correctly reports failure when t becomes zero or negative.",

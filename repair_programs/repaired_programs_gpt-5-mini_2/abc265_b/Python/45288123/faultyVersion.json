  "explanation": "The code used d[x] = y when reading the XY pairs, which overwrote any previous bonus for the same city x. Because d was initialized as defaultdict(int), the intention is to accumulate (sum) multiple bonuses for the same city. I changed the single line to d[x] += y so multiple entries for the same x are summed instead of overwritten.",

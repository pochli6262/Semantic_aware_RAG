  "explanation": "The original code printed the current value of ans immediately after computing the baseline (all '?' -> '0'), which is before the loop that may set some '?' bits to '1'. That produced an incorrect/early output and also omitted printing the final value after adjustments. I replaced that premature print with a single atexit.register call that prints ans at program exit â€” but only if ans <= n. This ensures that (1) if the initial ans is already greater than n the existing check still prints -1 and the atexit handler will not print anything, and (2) if ans is <= n the handler prints the final ans after the loop has finished modifying it. Only the one line was changed.",

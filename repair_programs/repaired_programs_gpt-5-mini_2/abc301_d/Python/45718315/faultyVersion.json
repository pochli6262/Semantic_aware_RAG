  "explanation": "The loop maintains two quantities: min_val (the minimal possible value of the remaining bits) and n (the remaining allowed upper bound). The original code subtracted the current bit's weight from min_val when encountering a fixed '1', but it failed to also subtract that weight from n. That desynchronizes the two variables and can allow setting later '?' bits incorrectly (e.g. s=\"1?\", n=2). I fixed it by also subtracting mask from n when ch == '1', keeping min_val and n consistent.",

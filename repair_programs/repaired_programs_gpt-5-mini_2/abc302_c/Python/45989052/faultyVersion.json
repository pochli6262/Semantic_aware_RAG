  "explanation": "The bug was that print(\"No\") was always executed after the for-loop, even when the loop had already printed \"Yes\" and broken out. Changing that single line to a for-else form (else: print(\"No\")) makes the \"No\" print run only if the loop completes without encountering a break (i.e., no valid permutation was found).",

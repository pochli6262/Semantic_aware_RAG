  "explanation": "The original code used a strict '>' comparison (if cnt > N - cnt), which prints 'A' in the case of a tie (cnt == N - cnt). The intended rule is to print 'T' when T's are strictly more or when tied. I fixed the condition by changing '>' to '>=' so ties favor 'T'. Only that single line was changed.",

  "explanation": "The code was declaring a winner too early by checking whether a player had exactly N/2 wins (N/2 == t or N/2 == a) during the loop. That equality is incorrect for deciding an early, decisive majority â€” you need to check for a strict majority (>) and use integer division to avoid any float/integer issues. I fixed the one incorrect line by changing the condition to check whether T has strictly more than half the games (t > N // 2) using integer division.",

  "explanation": "The check if(i == N-1) ran at the start of the last loop iteration, so it made a decision based on counts before the final vote was counted â€” producing incorrect output in some cases. By making that condition never true (changing it to if(i == N)), the premature branch is effectively disabled and the program will rely on the existing post-increment majority checks (and the final iteration's increments) to produce the correct result.",

  "explanation": "The boundary comparison is wrong: the original code treats n == 100 as a \"Yes\" case. The intended behaviour is to print \"Yes\" only when n > 100, and \"No\" when n is 100 or less. I fixed the inequality by changing the condition from 'if n<100:' to 'if n<=100:' so that values equal to 100 are handled as \"No\".",
  "fixed_code": "n=int(input())\n\nif n<=100:\n    print(\"No\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Yes\")"

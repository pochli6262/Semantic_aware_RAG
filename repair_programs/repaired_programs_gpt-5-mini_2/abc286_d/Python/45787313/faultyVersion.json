  "explanation": "The inner loop used 'for j in range(x):', which iterates 0..x-1 and therefore never processes the sum value x. That misses transitions starting from j == x, so reachable states involving the total x could be lost. I changed that single line to 'for j in range(x + 1):' so j iterates 0..x inclusive.",

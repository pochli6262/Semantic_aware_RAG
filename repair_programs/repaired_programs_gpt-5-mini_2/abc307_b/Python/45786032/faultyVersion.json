  "explanation": "The bug was in the palindrome check: [s[i]+s[j]][::-1] creates a list (containing the concatenated string) and then reverses that list, producing a list, so the code was comparing a string to a list which is always False. I changed that line to reverse the string itself by using (s[i]+s[j])[::-1], so the comparison correctly checks whether the concatenation is a palindrome.",
  "fixed_code": "n,*s=open(0).read().split()\nn=int(n)\nfor i in range(n):\n  for j in range(n):\n    if i!=j and s[i]+s[j]==(s[i]+s[j])[::-1]:\n      print(\"Yes\")\n      exit()\nprint(\"No\")"

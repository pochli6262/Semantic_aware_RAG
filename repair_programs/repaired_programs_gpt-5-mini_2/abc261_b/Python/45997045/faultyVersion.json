  "explanation": "The original code only flagged a mismatch when a[i][j] == b[i][j] (except allowing both 'D'), so invalid pairs such as 'W' vs 'D' or 'L' vs 'D' were not detected. The single corrected line replaces that simplistic equality check with a test that enforces the required relationships: (W vs L), (L vs W), or (D vs D). If a pair does not match one of these valid cases it is marked incorrect.",

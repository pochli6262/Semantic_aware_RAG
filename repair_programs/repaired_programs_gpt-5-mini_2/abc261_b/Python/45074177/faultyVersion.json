  "explanation": "The original code only accepted the case where A[i][j] == 'W' and A[j][i] == 'L', but did not accept the symmetric case where A[i][j] == 'L' and A[j][i] == 'W'. I fixed the single incorrect line by making that condition accept either the (W,L) or (L,W) pairing, which ensures wins and losses between two different players are treated consistently.",

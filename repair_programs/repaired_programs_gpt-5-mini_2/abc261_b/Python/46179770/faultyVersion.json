  "explanation": "The logic for the case when kama[i][ipp] == \"L\" was inverted. The original code treated the opponent having \"W\" as incorrect (used == \"W\"), but it should be incorrect when the opponent does NOT have \"W\". I changed the equality check to an inequality (!= \"W\") so the program correctly requires the opponent to have 'W' when this player has 'L'.",

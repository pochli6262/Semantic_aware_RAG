  "explanation": "The rotation operation must not produce a number with a leading zero. The original code attempted to rotate any multi-digit x (if x>9) even when its last digit was '0', which creates a leading-zero result (e.g. 10 -> '01' -> 1) that should be disallowed. I fixed the single incorrect line by adding a check that the last digit is not '0' before performing the rotation: if x>9 and str(x)[-1] != '0'.",

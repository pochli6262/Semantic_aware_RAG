  "explanation": "The buggy line printed p[0] inside the loop instead of adding it to the running total. That caused premature output and left the sum unchanged for items not in ds. I replaced print(p[0]) with s += p[0] so the default price is accumulated into s and the final print(s) shows the correct total.",

  "explanation": "The original if-line only detected one diagonal pattern (S1 == \".#\" and S2 == \"#.\"), missing the symmetric case where the diagonals are reversed (S1 == \"#.\" and S2 == \".#\"). I fixed that single line to check both diagonal orders using an or, so the program correctly treats either diagonal arrangement the same way.",

  "explanation": "The function ends with a bare `return`, so when black < 3 and the two blacks are not on the diagonal the code never prints anything. The final line in solve() should print \"Yes\" for that case. I replaced the trailing `return` with `print(\"Yes\")` so the non-diagonal case outputs \"Yes\".",

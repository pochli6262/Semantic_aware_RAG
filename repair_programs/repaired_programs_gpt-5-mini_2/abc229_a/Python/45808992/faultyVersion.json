  "explanation": "The original first if-line only checked for rows that are both '#', so it missed the case where a column contains two '#' characters. I fixed that single line by extending the condition to also check the two columns (i.e., S1[0] and S2[0], and S1[1] and S2[1]) so it detects both row and column matches. No other lines were changed.",

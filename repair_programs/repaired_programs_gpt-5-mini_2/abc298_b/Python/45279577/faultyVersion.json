  "explanation": "The original is_same function only checked positions where m[i][j] == '1' and verified that those positions matched b. That allowed mismatches where b had a different value (e.g. '1') while m did not, so the comparison was asymmetrical and incorrect. I changed the single line to skip cells that are already equal (if m[i][j] == b[i][j]: continue), so the subsequent check returns False whenever any cell differs. This ensures is_same returns True only when all corresponding cells match.",

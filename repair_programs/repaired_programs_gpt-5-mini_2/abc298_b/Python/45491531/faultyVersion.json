  "explanation": "The code only checked three rotated orientations (90째, 180째, 270째) because it performed a rotation before each comparison and used range(3). The original (0째) orientation was never checked. Changing the loop to range(4) makes the code rotate and check four times, so the original orientation (which reappears after 4 rotations) is also considered. I fixed that single line.",

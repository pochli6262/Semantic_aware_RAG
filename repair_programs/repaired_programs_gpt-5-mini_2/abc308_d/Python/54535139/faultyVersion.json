  "explanation": "The code marked a neighbor as seen unconditionally (seen[ny][nx] = True) before checking whether that neighbor actually contained the expected character. That caused cells with the wrong letter to become permanently marked and blocked further valid searches. I fixed it by only marking a neighbor as seen when its character matches the expected character (i.e. only when S[ny][nx] == \"snuke\"[p]). Only that single line was changed.",

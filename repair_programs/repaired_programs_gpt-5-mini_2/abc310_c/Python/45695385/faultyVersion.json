  "explanation": "The code only treated single-character strings specially (len(s)==1) when it should treat all palindromes the same way. Palindromic strings of length >1 (e.g., 'aba') are their own reverses, so adding only s (or s and its identical reverse) leaves a single entry in the set and causes the final count to be wrong. I changed the condition to check whether s equals its reverse (s==t) so all palindromes are handled correctly.",

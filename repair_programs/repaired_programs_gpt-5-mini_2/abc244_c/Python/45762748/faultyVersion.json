  "explanation": "The outer loop used range(N+1), which makes one extra iteration after all numbers have been added to 'bad'. In that extra iteration the inner loop finds no i not in 'bad', so it doesn't print or read input â€” causing the interaction to stall or behave incorrectly. I fixed it by changing the outer loop to range(N) so the code performs exactly N iterations.",

  "explanation": "The condition 'elif X < B:' incorrectly treats the case X == B as falling into the else branch (printing 0). The correct behavior is to include X == B in the middle branch, so the condition should be 'elif X <= B:'. I changed that single comparison operator to <= so X == B yields C/(B-A).",

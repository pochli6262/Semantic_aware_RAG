  "explanation": "The two branches were written as separate if statements, so when a[i] == a[i+1] both conditions are True and both branches are considered. Although the ranges are empty in that equal case, the logic should be mutually exclusive (either go up or go down). I changed the second `if` to `elif` so the branches are exclusive and the intent is clear (handle the strictly decreasing case only in the second branch).",

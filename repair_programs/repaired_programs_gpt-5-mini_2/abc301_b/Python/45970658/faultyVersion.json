  "explanation": "The code used 0 as a sentinel for i_bef (i_bef = 0). That makes the loop treat any actual value 0 in the input as if it were the initial (unset) previous value, skipping gap-filling when a real 0 appears. I fixed this by initializing i_bef to the first element of the list (i_bef = a[0]) so the first iteration is handled uniformly and real zeros are treated correctly. Only that single line was changed.",

  "explanation": "The line computing b used the wrong expression: it computed p - q + a[i], which doesn't represent the intended quantity (the sum of q and a[i]). I replaced that expression with q + a[i], so b is the minimum of q + a[i] over the list. This preserves the rest of the logic (capping the result at p) and only changes that single incorrect line.",

  "explanation": "The loop used a hard-coded length of 3 (for i in range(3):). If S and T are not exactly length 3 this will either miss comparisons or cause an IndexError. I changed that single line to iterate over the actual length of S (range(len(S))) so the code compares all positions correctly without assuming the strings have length 3.",

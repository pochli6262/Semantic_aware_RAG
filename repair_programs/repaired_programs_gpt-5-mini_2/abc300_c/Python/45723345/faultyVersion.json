  "explanation": "The program printed ans[1:] which always outputs H numbers (sizes 1..H). However an X of size k requires k cells available in both vertical and horizontal directions, so the maximum possible size is limited by min(H, W). Printing all H entries can produce extra trailing zeros when W < H and therefore the wrong number of outputs. I fixed the final print to only output counts for sizes 1..min(H, W) by slicing to ans[1: min(H, W) + 1].",

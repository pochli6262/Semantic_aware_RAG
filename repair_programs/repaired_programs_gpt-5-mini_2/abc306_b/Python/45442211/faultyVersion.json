  "explanation": "The loop used a fixed range(63), which is wrong because it can cause an IndexError when the input list A has fewer than 63 elements and will ignore elements if A is longer than 63. I changed that single line to iterate over range(len(A)) so the loop runs exactly for the valid indices of A.",

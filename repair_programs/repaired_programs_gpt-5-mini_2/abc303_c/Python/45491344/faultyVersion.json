  "explanation": "The bug is on the line 'item[(now[0],now[1])] == 0'. The '==' operator is a comparison, not an assignment, so the apple at the current position was never removed. That can cause the program to incorrectly reuse the same apple repeatedly. I fixed it by replacing '==' with the assignment operator '=' so the apple is properly removed.",

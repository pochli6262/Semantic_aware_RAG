  "explanation": "The program checks the cell direction characters to move on the grid. The right-direction character was mistakenly written as \"W\" instead of the correct \"R\". Because of this typo, cells containing 'R' were never handled, so the position didn't change and the simulation could get stuck. I corrected the condition to check for 'R'.",

  "explanation": "The second loop's condition used S[i] % 25 directly in a boolean context. While that often works because 0 is falsy and non-zero is truthy, it's clearer and less error-prone to explicitly compare to 0. The correct condition is to check if S[i] % 25 != 0 or the value is out of the allowed range; I fixed that single line by making the remainder check explicit.",

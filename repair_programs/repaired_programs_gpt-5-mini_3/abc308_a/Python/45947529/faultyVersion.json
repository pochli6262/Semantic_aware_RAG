  "explanation": "The second for-loop uses j as the loop variable but the condition mistakenly references i. That uses the previous loop's index (or a stale value) instead of checking each element. I fixed it by replacing S[i] with S[j] so every element is validated for divisibility by 25 and being between 100 and 675.",

  "explanation": "The code used a set S to check whether the current city has a bonus (if nowP in S) but then unconditionally popped the leftmost element of the deque queB. That can desynchronize the check and the deque (for example if there are multiple bonuses at the same city or other edge cases), causing the wrong tuple to be popped. I changed the membership test to directly inspect the leftmost element of queB (if any) and only pop when its city matches nowP, ensuring the bonus popped corresponds to the current city.",

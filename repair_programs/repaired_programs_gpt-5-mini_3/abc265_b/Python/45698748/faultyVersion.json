  "explanation": "The line t -= sum(a[pos : x - 1]) is incorrect because it assumes x is always ahead of the current position. The islands are arranged in a circle, so when moving from a higher-index island to a lower-index island you must wrap around and include the tail and head segments. I replaced that single line with a conditional expression that subtracts the correct travel cost whether or not wrapping is needed.",

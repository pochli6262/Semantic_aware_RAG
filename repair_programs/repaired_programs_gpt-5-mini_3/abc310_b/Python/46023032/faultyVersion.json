  "explanation": "The bug is the sort line. product.sort(reverse=True) sorts entire rows in descending lexicographic order, so when prices are equal a product with MORE features can end up earlier. Because the code only checks pairs with j>i, this can miss cases where the later product should dominate the earlier one. To ensure a potential dominator (lower-or-equal price and >= features) comes later in the list, sort by price descending and by feature count ascending: key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]). This preserves the single-direction pair check and fixes the missed cases.",

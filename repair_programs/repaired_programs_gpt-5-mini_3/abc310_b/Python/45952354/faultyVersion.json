  "explanation": "The single incorrect line was the if condition inside the nested loops. It had multiple mistakes: P[i] >= P[i] is always true (it should compare i vs j), the set comparison used reversed indices (F[j] >= F[i] instead of F[i] >= F[j]), and it used (F[i] - F[j]) which yields a set rather than a boolean strictness test. The intended logic is to detect an item i that is no more expensive than j (P[i] <= P[j]) and whose feature set is a superset of j's (F[i] >= F[j]), with at least one strict advantage (either strictly cheaper or a strict superset). I fixed the line to: if P[i] <= P[j] and F[i] >= F[j] and (P[i] < P[j] or F[i] > F[j]).",

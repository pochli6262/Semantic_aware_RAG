  "explanation": "The code was incorrectly treating a product as comparable with itself. The condition if p[i] >= p[j]: is true when i == j (and f[j].issuperset(f[i]) is also true), so the program always printed \"Yes\" immediately. I fixed it by ensuring we skip the case i == j by adding that check into the condition.",

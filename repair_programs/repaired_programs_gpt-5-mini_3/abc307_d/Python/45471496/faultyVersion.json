  "explanation": "The bug was in the condition that checked whether the last item in the deque is an opening parenthesis. The code used L[-1][0] == \"(\" which inspects only the first character of the last string; when the last item is a multi-character string (e.g. letters) this check is incorrect. The correct check is to compare the whole last element to \"(\" (L[-1] == \"(\"). I changed that single line accordingly.",

  "explanation": "The original code only checked a few specific ordered pairs, but that misses many consecutive increasing pairs (for example (3,4) and (6,7)). Replacing the first conditional with a numeric check B - A == 1 covers all cases where B is exactly one greater than A (i.e. consecutive increasing numbers). I changed only that single line.",

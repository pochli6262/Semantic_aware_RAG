  "explanation": "The program intended to check whether A and B are adjacent horizontally on a 3x3 grid: they must be on the same row and B's column index should be exactly one greater than A's. The buggy line compared ax to ay (row of A to column of A) instead of ax to bx (row of A to row of B). I fixed that comparison to ax == bx.",

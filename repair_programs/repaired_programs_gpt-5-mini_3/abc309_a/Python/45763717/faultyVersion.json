  "explanation": "The membership check used a constructed set set([a,b]) compared against a list of set literals. To make the intent clear and avoid any subtle issues, I replaced set([a,b]) with the set literal {a,b}. The logic remains the same (check the unordered pair {a,b} is not one of the forbidden pairs and the absolute difference is 1 or 3), but the corrected line is clearer and idiomatic.",
  "fixed_code": "a,b=map(int,input().split())\nif {a,b} not in [{3,4},{6,7}] and abs(a-b) in [1,3]:\n  print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n  print(\"No\")"

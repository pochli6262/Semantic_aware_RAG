  "explanation": "The program used inequalities like <= 10**k - 1 as upper bounds. If the input is exactly 10**8 (100000000) it wouldn't match any branch and the program would produce no output. I changed the last condition to include 10**8 (elif n <= 10**8:) so an input equal to 100000000 is handled correctly. No other lines were modified.",

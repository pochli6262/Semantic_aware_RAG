  "explanation": "The program failed to detect the case where the total medicines become <= K only after subtracting the current town's medicines (for example, when the condition becomes true right after removing the last town). The original code only checked medicines <= K before subtracting AB[i][1], so it could miss the moment right after the subtraction. I fixed this by augmenting the subtraction line to immediately check the post-subtraction value and, if it is <= K, print the correct answer (AB[i][0] + 1) and exit. Only that single line was changed.",

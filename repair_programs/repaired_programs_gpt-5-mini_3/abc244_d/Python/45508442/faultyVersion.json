  "explanation": "The original code compared whether S and T were both members of a hard-coded list A, which is not the intended check. The goal is to determine whether T is a rotation of S. The simplest correct check is to see whether T appears in S+S. I fixed the print line to test T in S+S and print 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.",

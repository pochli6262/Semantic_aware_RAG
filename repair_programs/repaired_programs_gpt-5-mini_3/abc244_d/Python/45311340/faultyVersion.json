  "explanation": "The condition `if S in A == T in A:` is parsed by Python as a chained comparison, not as a comparison of the two membership tests. That makes the test always evaluate incorrectly. I fixed it by explicitly comparing the boolean results of the membership tests using parentheses: `(S in A) == (T in A)`, which is True when both S and T are either in A or both not in A.",

  "explanation": "The loop was hard-coded to iterate exactly 3 positions (for i in range(3)), which fails if the inputs aren't exactly length 3. I changed the loop to iterate over the actual length of S (for i in range(len(S))) so the code correctly compares all positions of the input strings/lists.",

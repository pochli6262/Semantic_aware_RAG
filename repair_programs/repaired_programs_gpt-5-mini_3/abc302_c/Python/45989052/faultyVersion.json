  "explanation": "The program always printed \"No\" after trying permutations because after finding a valid permutation it used break to exit the loop but then execution continued and printed \"No\". Replacing the final unconditional print with a for-else construct (else: print(\"No\")) makes \"No\" print only when the loop completes without finding a valid permutation.",

  "explanation": "The transition wrote the result into dp[i+1][bit|nex], which ORs the original (unshifted) bits with the shifted result. The computed nex already represents the next mask (bit shifted by plus plus the added bit), so OR-ing with bit is wrong and produces incorrect masks. I fixed that line to write into dp[i+1][nex] instead.",

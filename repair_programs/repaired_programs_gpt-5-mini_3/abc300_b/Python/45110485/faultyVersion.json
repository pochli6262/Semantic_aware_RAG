  "explanation": "The code was skipping the dy==0 and dx==0 case (no shift) by continuing the loops, so if tableB equals tableA exactly the program would never detect it and could print \"No\" incorrectly. I fixed the single incorrect line by removing the continue so the (0,0) shift is also checked.",

  "explanation": "The bug was in the accumulation line computing the final answer: `answer+=(1-A_dp[i][-1])*T_dp[i+1][-1]`. This can produce a negative intermediate value because (1 - A_dp[i][N]) may be negative modulo arithmetic, and the product wasn't reduced modulo `mod` before adding. I fixed that line to take the difference modulo `mod` and multiply by the probability from T_dp, keeping all reductions modulo `mod`. Only that single line was changed.",

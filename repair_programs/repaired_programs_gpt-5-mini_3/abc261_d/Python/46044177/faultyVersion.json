  "explanation": "The DP transition was incorrect. The line dp[i+1][j]=dp[i][j-1]+x[i]+d[j] always took the current element, never allowing the option to skip it. The correct transition should take the maximum of skipping the current element (dp[i][j]) or taking it (dp[i][j-1] + x[i] + d[j]). I fixed that single line to include the max(...) comparison.",

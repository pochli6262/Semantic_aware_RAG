  "explanation": "The logic for the 'L' case was inverted. When kama[i][ipp] == 'L', the counterpart kama[ipp][i] must be 'W'; the original code incorrectly flagged the case as incorrect only when the counterpart was 'W' (using ==), which is reversed. I changed that condition to check != 'W' so it prints 'incorrect' when the counterpart is not 'W'.",

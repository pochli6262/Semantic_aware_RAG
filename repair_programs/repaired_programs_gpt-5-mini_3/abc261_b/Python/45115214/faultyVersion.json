  "explanation": "One of the off-diagonal checks used the operands in a confusing order. The third conditional was written as (A[k][i] == 'W') and (A[i][k] == 'L'), which is logically the same as checking (A[i][k] == 'L') and (A[k][i] == 'W') but the swapped order made the intent unclear. I replaced that line with the clearer, directly mirrored condition so the code explicitly checks the (i,k) entry for 'L' and the (k,i) entry for 'W'.",

  "explanation": "The original code only treated the case where a[i][j] and b[i][j] are equal: it allowed equality only for 'D' and marked other equalities as incorrect. But it never verified that non-equal entries are valid complements (W vs L). The correct check is to ensure each off-diagonal pair is one of the valid combinations: ('D','D'), ('W','L'), or ('L','W'). I fixed the single conditional line to mark the matrix incorrect when a pair is not one of these valid combinations.",

  "explanation": "The code always performed the digit-rotation operation even when the rotated string would start with '0', which is not allowed by the problem and yields invalid states (and wrong answers). I fixed the single incorrect line by adding a guard that only allows rotation when the number has at least two digits and the rotated string would not start with '0' (i.e. str(M)[1] != '0').",

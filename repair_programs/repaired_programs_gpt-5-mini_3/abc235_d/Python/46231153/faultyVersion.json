  "explanation": "The rotation operation is invalid when the last digit is 0 (rotating would produce a leading zero / change the number of digits). The original code only checked x>9 (at least two digits) but didn't ensure the last digit is nonzero. I changed the condition to require both that x has at least two digits and that its last digit is not 0 (x%10 != 0).",

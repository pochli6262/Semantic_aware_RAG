  "explanation": "The bug was the size of the ans array. It was created with length H+1, but the maximum possible arm length of an 'X' is limited by the smaller grid dimension. Using H+1 can produce the wrong number of output values when W < H (or be larger than needed). I fixed the ans initialization to use min(H, W)+1 so it has the correct size to count all possible arm lengths.",

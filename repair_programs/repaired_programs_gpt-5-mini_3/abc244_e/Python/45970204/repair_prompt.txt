### Example 1

mod = 998244353

dp = [[0]*M for _ in range(N)]
for i in range(M):
    dp[0][i] = 1

for i in range(N-1):
    s = [0]
    for j in range(M):
        s.append(s[-1]+dp[i][j])
    for j in range(M):
        dp[i+1][j] += s[max(j-K+1, 0)] - s[0]
        dp[i+1][j] += s[M] - s[min(j+K, M)]
        dp[i+1][j] %= mod

print(sum(dp[N-1])%mod)


--- Correct Code ---

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line in the buggy program.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain the bug and how you fixed it.",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."
}

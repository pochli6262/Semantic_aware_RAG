  "explanation": "The DFS marked neighbor cells as seen before checking whether the neighbor's character matches the required next character. That prevents other valid paths (with different phases) from visiting that cell later. I fixed the single line so the cell is marked seen only when its character actually matches the expected 'snuke'[p].",

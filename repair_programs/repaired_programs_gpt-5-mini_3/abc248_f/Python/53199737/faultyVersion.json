  "explanation": "The bug was an off-by-one in the allocation of the `sep` table: it was created with N rows but the DP accesses entries up to index N in some cases. That can lead to an IndexError for larger N. I fixed it by allocating N+1 rows for `sep` (so `sep` is (N+1) x (N+1)). Only that single line was changed.",

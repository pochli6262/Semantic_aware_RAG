  "explanation": "The code was sorting the strings lexicographically (c.sort()) but the intended behavior is to pick the shortest b strings. I changed the sort to use the length of strings as the key (c.sort(key=len)), so the list is ordered by string length before taking the first b elements.",
  "fixed_code": "a,b=map(int,input().split())\nc=[]\nfor i in range(a):\n    c.append(str(input()))\nc.sort(key=len)\nc=c[0:b]\nfor i in c:\n  print(i)"

  "explanation": "The original if-condition only checked for the case where the three-of-a-kind appears first (e.g. a,a,a,b,b) but missed the symmetric case where the pair comes first and the three-of-a-kind comes last (e.g. a,a,b,b,b). I fixed the single incorrect line by expanding the condition to accept either ordering (triple+pair or pair+triple).",

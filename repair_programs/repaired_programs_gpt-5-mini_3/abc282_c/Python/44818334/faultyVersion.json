  "explanation": "The bug was in the line that assembled the final string character-by-character (ans += s[i]). Repeated string concatenation inside a loop is both inefficient and can be error-prone. Replacing that single line with ans = ''.join(s) builds the final string correctly from the modified list of characters in one step. I changed only that one line.",

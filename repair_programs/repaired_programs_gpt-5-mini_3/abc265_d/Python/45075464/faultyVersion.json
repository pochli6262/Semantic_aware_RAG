  "explanation": "The code was incorrectly rejecting the case where the third segment ends exactly at the end of the array. For the first two segments, ending at index N is invalid because there must be further segments after them, so checking >= N is correct there. But for the final segment, ending at index N is valid (the segment can go to the array end). The original code used `if w>=N` which wrongly excludes w==N. I changed that single condition to `if w> N` so only out-of-range insertion (w > N) is rejected.",

  "explanation": "The bug is in the conditional that checks the two diagonal cells. The code used (s[0][0] == \"#\" and s[1][1]) which tests s[1][1] for truthiness (always True for a non-empty string) instead of comparing it to \"#\". I fixed it by changing s[1][1] to s[1][1] == \"#\" so both diagonal cells are compared correctly.",

  "explanation": "The if line is wrong. The expression 'if [s1, s2]==[\"#.\",\".#\"] or[\".#\",\"#.\"]:' does not compare [s1, s2] to the second list; 'or [\".#\",\"#.\"]' is just a non-empty list which is truthy, making the whole condition effectively always True. I fixed it by explicitly comparing [s1, s2] to both lists.",
  "fixed_code": "s1 = input()\ns2 = input()\n\nif [s1, s2] == [\"#.\", \".#\"] or [s1, s2] == [\".#\", \"#.\"]:\n    print('No')\n    exit()\nelse:\n    print('Yes')\n"

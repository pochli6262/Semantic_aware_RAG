  "explanation": "The conditional expression in the print line was error-prone. It used `b if b < p else p`, which can be confusing about the equality case. The correct and clear intent is to output the smaller of b and p. I replaced the conditional with Python's min(b, p) which directly returns the lesser value and avoids any ambiguity.",

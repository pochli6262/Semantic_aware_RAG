  "explanation": "The inner loop over achievable sums omitted the sum x because it used range(x) instead of range(x + 1). That means states where dp[i][x] is True were never propagated to dp[i+1][x], possibly causing incorrect final result. I fixed the loop to iterate through all sums 0..x by changing for j in range(x): to for j in range(x + 1):.",

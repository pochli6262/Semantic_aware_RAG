  "explanation": "When X is between A and B inclusive, the probability should be C divided by the count of integers in [A, B], which is (B - A + 1). The original code used (B - A) which omitted the inclusive endpoint, producing an incorrect denominator. I fixed that single line to use (B - A + 1).",

  "explanation": "The bug was the use of the variable `c` in the probability calculation. In the middle branch the code should compute the fraction of integers in [a,b] that are >= x, which is (b - x + 1) divided by the interval length (b - a + 1). The original code mistakenly used `c/(b-a+1)`. I replaced that line with the correct expression.",
  "fixed_code": "a,b,c,x=map(int,input().split())\nif a>=x:\n    print(1)\nelif b>=x>a:\n    print((b-x+1)/(b-a+1))\nelse:\n    print(0)"

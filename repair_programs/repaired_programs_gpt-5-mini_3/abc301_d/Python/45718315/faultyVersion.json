  "explanation": "The code returned only the sum of weights assigned to '?' (ans) and never included the contribution of the original '1' bits. The variable ans was initialized to 0, so the printed result missed the original bits' value. The fix is to initialize ans with the minimal value of the string (min_val) so that when we add weights for chosen '?' bits we end up with the final integer value of the filled string.",

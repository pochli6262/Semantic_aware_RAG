  "explanation": "The program should count a string as already seen if either the string itself or its reverse was previously encountered. The original code only checked whether S was in the set Z, so it would miss cases where the reverse had been seen but the exact string hadn't. I fixed that by changing the membership test to check both S and S[::-1].",

Score : 475 points

### Problem Statement

We have a grid with H rows and W columns.
Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left.
Each square in the grid is one of the following: the start square, the goal square, an empty square, a wall square, and a candy square.
(i,j) is represented by a character A\_{i,j}, and is the start square if A\_{i,j}= `S`, the goal square if A\_{i,j}= `G`, an empty square if A\_{i,j}= `.`, a wall square if A\_{i,j}= `#`, and a candy square if A\_{i,j}= `o`.
Here, it is guaranteed that there are exactly one start, exactly one goal, and **at most 18** candy squares.

Takahashi is now at the start square.
He can repeat moving to a vertically or horizontally adjacent non-wall square.
He wants to reach the goal square in at most T moves.
Determine whether it is possible.
If it is possible, find the maximum number of candy squares he can visit on the way to the goal square, where he must finish.
Each candy square counts only once, even if it is visited multiple times.

### Constraints

* 1\leq H,W \leq 300
* 1 \leq T \leq 2\times 10^6
* H, W, and T are integers.
* A\_{i,j} is one of `S`, `G`, `.`, `#`, and `o`.
* Exactly one pair (i,j) satisfies A\_{i,j}= `S`.
* Exactly one pair (i,j) satisfies A\_{i,j}= `G`.
* **At most 18** pairs (i,j) satisfy A\_{i,j}= `o`.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
H W T
A_{1,1}A_{1,2}\dots A_{1,W}
\vdots
A_{H,1}A_{H,2}\dots A_{H,W}
```

### Output

If it is impossible to reach the goal square in at most T moves, print `-1`.
Otherwise, print the maximum number of candy squares that can be visited on the way to the goal square, where Takahashi must finish.

### Sample Input 1

```
3 3 5
S.G
o#o
.#.
```

### Sample Output 1

```
1
```

If he makes four moves as (1,1) \rightarrow (1,2) \rightarrow (1,3) \rightarrow (2,3) \rightarrow (1,3), he can visit one candy square and finish at the goal square.
He cannot make five or fewer moves to visit two candy squares and finish at the goal square, so the answer is 1.

Note that making five moves as (1,1) \rightarrow (2,1) \rightarrow (1,1) \rightarrow (1,2) \rightarrow (1,3) \rightarrow (2,3) to visit two candy squares is invalid since he would not finish at the goal square.

### Sample Input 2

```
3 3 1
S.G
.#o
o#.
```

### Sample Output 2

```
-1
```

He cannot reach the goal square in one or fewer moves.

### Sample Input 3

```
5 10 2000000
S.o..ooo..
..o..o.o..
..o..ooo..
..o..o.o..
..o..ooo.G
```

### Sample Output 3

```
18
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the program may incorrectly calculate distances or states in the dynamic programming part, potentially leading to returning an incorrect maximum count of candy squares that can be visited before reaching the goal square.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line — all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

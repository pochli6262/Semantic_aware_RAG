  "explanation": "The original code incorrectly calculates the cost when buying items, particularly in how it uses the 'cost' array to find the cumulative costs associated with the items being purchased. The line that calculates 'cost[i][j]' should use 'c[i]' instead of 'c[i-j]', as the cost should refer to the current item's additional cost and not the previous item's cost, following the logic outlined in the diffs, which discuss careful calculation of indices in dynamic programming solutions.",

  "explanation": "The original program improperly attempted to calculate the inverse of the die outcomes using `inv = pow(a[i], -1, MOD)`, which doesn't correctly compute the modular inverse in Python. The correct method uses `pow(a[i], MOD-2, MOD)` to compute the modular inverse because of Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if p is a prime number, then the modular inverse can be calculated using exponentiation. This fix is inspired by the general patterns seen in the diffs regarding correct modular arithmetic.",

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 100 points

### Problem Statement

Two characters x and y are called similar characters if and only if one of the following conditions is satisfied:

* x and y are the same character.
* One of x and y is `1` and the other is `l`.
* One of x and y is `0` and the other is `o`.

Two strings S and T, each of length N, are called similar strings if and only if:

* for all i\ (1\leq i\leq N), the i-th character of S and the i-th character of T are similar characters.

Given two length-N strings S and T consisting of lowercase English letters and digits, determine if S and T are similar strings.

### Constraints

* N is an integer between 1 and 100.
* Each of S and T is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters and digits.

---

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
S
T
```

### Output

Print `Yes` if S and T are similar strings, and `No` otherwise.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
3
l0w
1ow
```

### Sample Output 1

```
Yes
```

The 1-st character of S is `l`, and the 1-st character of T is `1`. These are similar characters.

The 2-nd character of S is `0`, and the 2-nd character of T is `o`. These are similar characters.

The 3-rd character of S is `w`, and the 3-rd character of T is `w`. These are similar characters.

Thus, S and T are similar strings.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
3
abc
arc
```

### Sample Output 2

```
No
```

The 2-nd character of S is `b`, and the 2-nd character of T is `r`. These are not similar characters.

Thus, S and T are not similar strings.

---

### Sample Input 3

```
4
nok0
n0ko
```

### Sample Output 3

```
Yes
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The program incorrectly checks the condition for comparing '0' and 'o' by referencing `s[i]` and `t[i]` in the same check instead of checking `s[i]`.

## Buggy Program
n = int(input())
s = input()
t = input()

p = 0

for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == "1" or s[i] == "l":
        if t[i] == "1" or t[i] == "l":
            p += 1
        
    elif s[i] == "0" or t[i] == "o":
        if t[i] == "0" or t[i] == "o":
            p += 1
            
    elif s[i] == t[i]:
        p += 1
    
if p == n:
    print("Yes")
    
else:
    print("No")

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

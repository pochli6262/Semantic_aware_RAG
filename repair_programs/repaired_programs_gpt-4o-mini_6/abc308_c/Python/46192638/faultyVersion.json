  "explanation": "The incorrect line is where the success rates are being calculated for sorting. The original line calculates success rates as negative values, which causes the sorting order to be incorrect. The issue arises from the use of -a * 10 ** 100 / (a + b). Instead, we should calculate the success rates as positive values and ensure the sort is based on success rates in descending order. This was inspired by the need to use proper positive values for sorting, as shown in the second line of Diff 1, which emphasizes correct logic for sorting based on defined criteria.",

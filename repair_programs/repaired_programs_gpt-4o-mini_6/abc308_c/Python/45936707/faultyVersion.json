  "explanation": "The original code does not handle the case when A_i is zero, which results in a division by zero error when calculating the success rate. I fixed this by changing the division line to use a conditional expression that ensures that if A_i is zero, the success rate is set to 0 instead of causing an error. This approach is inspired by the need to handle edge cases that the original line does not account for.",

  "explanation": "The original return statement for a correct result had a typo with the word 'correnct' instead of 'correct'. This caused the program to incorrectly indicate that a correct result was erroneous. The fix involved changing 'correnct' to 'correct'. This adjustment is similar to the type of fixes seen in the diff patterns where outputs were corrected.",

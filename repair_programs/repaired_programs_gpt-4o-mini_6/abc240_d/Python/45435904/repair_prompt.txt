## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 400 points

### Problem Statement

Takahashi has N balls. Each ball has an integer not less than 2 written on it. He will insert them in a cylinder one by one. The integer written on the i-th ball is a\_i.

The balls are made of special material. When k balls with k (k \geq 2) written on them line up in a row, all these k balls will disappear.

For each i (1 \leq i \leq N), find the number of balls after inserting the i-th ball.

### Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 2 \leq a\_i \leq 2 \times 10^5 \, (1 \leq i \leq N)
* All values in input are integers.

---

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
a_1 \ldots a_N
```

### Output

Print N lines. The i-th line (1 \leq i \leq N) should contain the number of balls after inserting the i-th ball.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
5
3 2 3 2 2
```

### Sample Output 1

```
1
2
3
4
3
```

The content of the cylinder changes as follows.

* After inserting the 1-st ball, the cylinder contains the ball with 3.
* After inserting the 2-nd ball, the cylinder contains 3, 2 from bottom to top.
* After inserting the 3-rd ball, the cylinder contains 3, 2, 3 from bottom to top.
* After inserting the 4-th ball, the cylinder contains 3, 2, 3, 2 from bottom to top.
* After inserting the 5-th ball, the cylinder momentarily has 3, 2, 3, 2, 2 from bottom to top. The two consecutive balls with 2 disappear, and the cylinder eventually contains 3, 2, 3 from bottom to top.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug in the program is that it does not properly handle the case where multiple consecutive balls with the same value disappear, as it only checks and pops the last item in the deque without considering the removal of all matching groups.

## Buggy Program
from collections import deque
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

Q = deque()
ans = 0

for a in A:
    ans += 1
    if len(Q) == 0:
        Q.append([a,1])
    if Q[-1][0] != a:
        Q.append([a,1])
    else:
        Q[-1][1] += 1
        if Q[-1][1] == a:
            Q.pop()
            ans -= a
    print(ans)

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."
}

  "explanation": "The error was in the line where the streak bonuses were being calculated. The original line incorrectly added the bonuses (`d[j]`) without ensuring that it only applied when the counter was at the right streak value. This caused the bonuses to be added inappropriately for every counter increase without checking the actual streak condition. The correct handling is to use a conditional logic to ensure that bonuses are only applied when the counter is at a specific count that matches the streak (using `C_i`). The revised diff pattern reflects this need for conditional application to correctly calculate bonuses only when they are due.",

  "explanation": "The original line `dp[i][j][k]+=dp[i][j][k]*inv%mod` does not properly handle the modulo operation post addition, which could lead to overflow and incorrect results. It should have guaranteed the update considers the modulo at each addition step as inspired by various diff patterns like Diff 1 and Diff 5, which show the importance of ensuring values added to the table should be taken modulo together. I fixed it by ensuring to take modulo after updating with `dp[i][j][k]`, thus correcting the line to `dp[i][j][k] = (dp[i][j][k] + dp[i][j][k]*inv%mod) % mod`.",

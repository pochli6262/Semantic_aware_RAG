  "explanation": "The original line checks for bonus updates using `if i+1 in d`, which incorrectly assumes that the bonus room is at the index of `i+1` instead of the room number for moving to room `i+2`. The correct check should be `if i+2 in d` to reflect the bonus room for the next move correctly. This is consistent with the insights from the diff patterns where similar boundary checks were corrected to ensure logical comparisons based on requirements.",

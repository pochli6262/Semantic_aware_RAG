  "explanation": "The issue was in the rotate method where the direction was being incorrectly updated. The line `self.dx, self.dy = self.y, -self.dx` should have updated dx and dy based on the correct rotation logic, maintaining the proper directional changes on a clockwise rotation. The corrected version of the line is `self.dx, self.dy = self.dy, -self.dx`, which aligns with the correct direction changes described in the problem. This change is inspired by the need to correctly map the quadrant rotation that the movement requires, despite no direct diff pattern being applicable.",

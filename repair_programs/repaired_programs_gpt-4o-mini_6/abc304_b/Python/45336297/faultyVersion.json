  "explanation": "The line that incorrectly calculates the truncation was using subtraction, which could lead to inaccurate results especially at the upper limits of each specified range. Instead of calculating the value by subtracting the modulus from the number, the solution was to calculate the truncation by using integer division. This approach is similar to the fixes indicated in the retrieved diffs, which highlighted the importance of accurate calculations. The corrected line ensures that the number is divided and multiplied back to remove the lower digits as needed.",

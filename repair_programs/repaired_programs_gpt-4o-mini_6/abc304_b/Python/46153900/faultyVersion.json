  "explanation": "The function was incorrectly named 'range', which conflicts with the built-in Python function of the same name, leading to unexpected behavior. To fix this, I renamed the function to 'determine_range', which does not clash with any built-in names. This was inspired by the context of known fixes avoiding the use of 'range' for user-defined functions.",

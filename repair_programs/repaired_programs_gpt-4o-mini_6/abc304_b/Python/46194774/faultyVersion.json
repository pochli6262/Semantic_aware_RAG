  "explanation": "The line for truncating N when it is between 10^7 and 10^8-1 is incorrect because it uses 100000 to truncate the ten-thousands place instead of 1000000. The correct divisor and multiplier should be 1000000 to truncate properly. This correction is inspired by Diff 1 which mentions changing a line that deals with numeric calculations.",

  "explanation": "The bug was in the line 'print((n // (10**i)) * 10**i)', which incorrectly calculated the truncation by using the current loop index 'i' instead of the correct power of ten based on the ranges specified. The corrected line ensures that the correct digit is truncated according to the requirements in the problem statement. The fixed line is derived from understanding the required truncation behavior compared to the given constraints in the problem description, rather than any specific diff patterns.",
  "fixed_code": "n = int(input())\n\nfor i in range(6):\n    if n <= 10**(3 + i) - 1:\n        print(n // (10**(i + 1)) * 10**(i + 1))\n        break"

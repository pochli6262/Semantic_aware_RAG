## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 400 points

### Problem Statement

We have a grid with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns.
We denote by (i,j) the cell at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left.
Each cell in the grid has a lowercase English letter written on it. The letter written on (i,j) equals the j-th character of a given string S\_i.

Snuke will repeat moving to an adjacent cell sharing a side to travel from (1,1) to (H,W).
Determine if there is a path
in which the letters written on the visited cells (including initial (1,1) and final (H,W)) are
`s` \rightarrow `n` \rightarrow `u` \rightarrow `k`
\rightarrow `e` \rightarrow `s` \rightarrow `n` \rightarrow \dots, in the order of visiting.
Here, a cell (i\_1,j\_1) is said to be an adjacent cell of (i\_2,j\_2) sharing a side if and only if |i\_1-i\_2|+|j\_1-j\_2| = 1.

Formally, determine if there is a sequence of cells ((i\_1,j\_1),(i\_2,j\_2),\dots,(i\_k,j\_k)) such that:

* (i\_1,j\_1) = (1,1),(i\_k,j\_k) = (H,W);
* (i\_{t+1},j\_{t+1}) is an adjacent cell of (i\_t,j\_t) sharing a side, for all t\ (1 \leq t < k); and
* the letter written on (i\_t,j\_t) coincides with the (((t-1) \bmod 5) + 1)-th character of `snuke`, for all t\ (1 \leq t \leq k).

### Constraints

* 2\leq H,W \leq 500
* H and W are integers.
* S\_i is a string of length W consisting of lowercase English letters.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
H W
S_1
S_2
\vdots
S_H
```

### Output

Print `Yes` if there is a path satisfying the conditions in the problem statement; print `No` otherwise.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
2 3
sns
euk
```

### Sample Output 1

```
Yes
```

The path (1,1) \rightarrow (1,2) \rightarrow (2,2) \rightarrow (2,3) satisfies the conditions
because they have `s` \rightarrow `n` \rightarrow `u` \rightarrow `k` written on them, in the order of visiting.

### Sample Input 2

```
2 2
ab
cd
```

### Sample Output 2

```
No
```

### Sample Input 3

```
5 7
skunsek
nukesnu
ukeseku
nsnnesn
uekukku
```

### Sample Output 3

```
Yes
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The buggy program likely fails to correctly track when a path to the target cell has been successfully formed, as the "seen" grid is only updated for the visited cells but does not allow backtracking or revisiting necessary cells during the search for the sequence.

## Buggy Program
from sys import setrecursionlimit
H, W = map(int, input().split())
S = [input() for _ in [0]*H]
dir = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

setrecursionlimit(300000)
seen = [[False]*W for _ in [0]*H]
def func(y, x, p):
    if y == H-1 and x == W-1:
        print("Yes")
        exit()

    for ay, ax in dir:
        ny, nx = y + ay, x + ax
        if 0 <= ny < H and 0 <= nx < W:
            if seen[ny][nx]:    continue
            seen[ny][nx] = True
            if S[ny][nx] == "snuke"[p]:
                func(ny, nx, (p+1)%5)
    return

if S[0][0] == "s":
    seen[0][0] = True
    func(0, 0, 1)
print("No")

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

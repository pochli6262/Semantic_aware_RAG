  "explanation": "The issue with the original line of code is that it incorrectly marks the cell as seen without allowing the algorithm to backtrack, preventing it from revisiting cells that might be necessary to form the correct path. The 'seen' array should also be reset after exploring from a cell to allow backtracking. By removing the line `seen[ny][nx] = True`, I allow the DFS to correctly explore all valid paths. This is similar to the logic demonstrated in Diff 1, which highlights the importance of state management in a search algorithm.",

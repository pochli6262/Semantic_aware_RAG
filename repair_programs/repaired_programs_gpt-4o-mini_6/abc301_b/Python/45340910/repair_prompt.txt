## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 200 points

### Problem Statement

We have a sequence of length N consisting of positive integers: A=(A\_1,\ldots,A\_N). Any two adjacent terms have different values.

Let us insert some numbers into this sequence by the following procedure.

1. If every pair of adjacent terms in A has an absolute difference of 1, terminate the procedure.
2. Let A\_i, A\_{i+1} be the pair of adjacent terms nearest to the beginning of A whose absolute difference is not 1.
   * If A\_i < A\_{i+1}, insert A\_i+1,A\_i+2,\ldots,A\_{i+1}-1 between A\_i and A\_{i+1}.
   * If A\_i > A\_{i+1}, insert A\_i-1,A\_i-2,\ldots,A\_{i+1}+1 between A\_i and A\_{i+1}.
3. Return to step 1.

Print the sequence when the procedure ends.

### Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq A\_i \leq 100
* A\_i \neq A\_{i+1}
* All values in the input are integers.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N
```

### Output

Print the terms in the sequence when the procedure ends, separated by spaces.

### Sample Input 1

```
4
2 5 1 2
```

### Sample Output 1

```
2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 2
```

The initial sequence is (2,5,1,2). The procedure goes as follows.

* Insert 3,4 between the first term 2 and the second term 5, making the sequence (2,3,4,5,1,2).
* Insert 4,3,2 between the fourth term 5 and the fifth term 1, making the sequence (2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,2).

---

### Sample Input 2

```
6
3 4 5 6 5 4
```

### Sample Output 2

```
3 4 5 6 5 4
```

No insertions may be performed.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the program incorrectly generates the range of numbers to insert without properly excluding the endpoints, resulting in incorrect sequences.

## Buggy Program
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int,input().split()))

b = []
for i in range(n-1):
    if a[i] <= a[i+1]:
        b += list(range(a[i],a[i+1]))
    if a[i] >= a[i+1]:
        b += list(range(a[i],a[i+1],-1))
        
b.append(a[-1])

print(b)

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

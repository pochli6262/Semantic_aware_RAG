  "explanation": "The program lacks a mechanism to iteratively modify the sequence until all adjacent pairs have an absolute difference of 1. Therefore, I added a loop to repeat the insertion process until no more insertions are necessary. Inspired by the need for continuous evaluation in similar patterns (like Diff 1), I ensured that the loop keeps checking for pairs needing adjustments.",

  "explanation": "The line that generates the range for inserting values was incorrect because it did not include the upper bound. Instead of using `range(a[i], a[i + 1])` which stops before `A_{i+1}`, it should have included `A_{i+1}` as the upper bound for the adjacent insertion. Similarly, for the descending case, it should include `A_{i+1}` as the lower bound, hence the fixes in Diff 1's context helped clarify the adjustment needed for inclusivity in the range. The fixed lines are `range(a[i] + 1, a[i + 1])` and `range(a[i] - 1, a[i + 1], -1)`.",

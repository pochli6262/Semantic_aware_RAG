  "explanation": "The original line 'print(abs(5-int(input())%5))' incorrectly calculates the distance to the nearest water station because it only considers the next water station, ignoring the previous one. The correct approach is to find the nearest station by checking both the lower and upper nearest water station positions. Inspired by the need to adjust calculations based on the nearest multiples of 5, I modified the line to properly identify the nearest water station. I referenced  Diff 4's approach of rounding to the nearest station.",
  "fixed_code": "print((int(input()) // 5) * 5 + (5 if int(input()) % 5 >= 3 else 0))"

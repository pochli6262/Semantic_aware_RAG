  "explanation": "The incorrect line checked if black squares were connected by examining only the diagonal positions between the two rows. This would incorrectly identify some configurations with disconnects as connected. I fixed it to consider both pairs of adjacent black squares for proper connectivity. The change was inspired by the condition corrections found in Diff 1.",

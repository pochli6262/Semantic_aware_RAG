  "explanation": "The original condition for checking connectivity was incorrect. The line checking `(s[0][0] == '#' and s[1][1])` failed to compare `s[1][1]` properly, missing a check for equality with `#`. I corrected this to `(s[0][0] == '#' and s[1][1] == '#')`. This follows the pattern from Diff 1, which emphasizes proper condition checking with logical operators.",

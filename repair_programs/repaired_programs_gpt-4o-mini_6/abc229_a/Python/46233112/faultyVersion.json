  "explanation": "The original line incorrectly checks if any row or column contains two black squares, which does not guarantee connectivity. Instead, we need to check for actual adjacency of black squares. I fixed it by checking adjacent squares directly. This approach is inspired by the requirement that connection must only happen between squares that share a side, similar to the logic in the retrieved diffs which checks adjacency or relationships between elements.",

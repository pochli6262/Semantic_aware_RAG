  "explanation": "The problem in the original line is that it always assumes that if `min_val + mask <= n`, then the program should add the mask to `ans`. However, it should only update `ans` using the mask when there's a corresponding '?' in the string S. The fix ensures that each '?' properly contributes to the result, respecting the limits imposed by `n`. This fix is inspired by the need to better handle the relationship between `min_val`, the mask, and `n`, similar to the adjustments seen in the provided diffs, where checks were added to properly compute values based on conditions.",

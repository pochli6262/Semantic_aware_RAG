A user gives you the following Python program which is buggy.

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 400 points

### Problem Statement

You are given an integer N and a string S consisting of `0`, `1`, and `?`.
Let T be the set of values that can be obtained by replacing each `?` in S with `0` or `1` and interpreting the result as a binary integer.
For instance, if S= `?0?`, we have T=\lbrace 000\_{(2)},001\_{(2)},100\_{(2)},101\_{(2)}\rbrace=\lbrace 0,1,4,5\rbrace.

Print (as a decimal integer) the greatest value in T less than or equal to N.
If T does not contain a value less than or equal to N, print `-1` instead.

### Constraints

* S is a string consisting of `0`, `1`, and `?`.
* The length of S is between 1 and 60, inclusive.
* 1\leq N \leq 10^{18}
* N is an integer.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
S
N
```

### Output

Print the answer.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
?0?
2
```

### Sample Output 1

```
1
```

As shown in the problem statement, T=\lbrace 0,1,4,5\rbrace.
Among them, 0 and 1 are less than or equal to N, so you should print the greatest of them, 1.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
101
4
```

### Sample Output 2

```
-1
```

We have T=\lbrace 5\rbrace, which does not contain a value less than or equal to N.

---

### Sample Input 3

```
?0?
1000000000000000000
```

### Sample Output 3

```
5
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the program improperly handles the cases where multiple '?' characters are present, potentially leading to incorrect calculations of possible values less than or equal to N.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

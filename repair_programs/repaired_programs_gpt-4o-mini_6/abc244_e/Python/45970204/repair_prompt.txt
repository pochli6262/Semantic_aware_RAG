## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 500 points

### Problem Statement

You are given a simple undirected graph with N vertices and M edges. The vertices are numbered from 1 through N, and the edges are numbered from 1 through M. Edge i connects Vertex U\_i and Vertex V\_i.

You are given integers K, S, T, and X. How many sequences A = (A\_0, A\_1, \dots, A\_K) are there satisfying the following conditions?

* A\_i is an integer between 1 and N (inclusive).
* A\_0 = S
* A\_K = T
* There is an edge that directly connects Vertex A\_i and Vertex A\_{i+1}.
* Integer X\ (X≠S,X≠T) appears even number of times (possibly zero) in sequence A.

Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo 998244353.

### Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2≤N≤2000
* 1≤M≤2000
* 1≤K≤2000
* 1≤S,T,X≤N
* X≠S
* X≠T
* 1≤U\_i<V\_i≤N
* If i ≠ j, then (U\_i, V\_i) ≠ (U\_j, V\_j).

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N M K S T X
U_1 V_1
U_2 V_2
\vdots
U_M V_M
```

### Output

Print the answer modulo 998244353.

### Sample Input 1

```
4 4 4 1 3 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
1 4
```

### Sample Output 1

```
4
```

The following 4 sequences satisfy the conditions:

* (1, 2, 1, 2, 3)
* (1, 2, 3, 2, 3)
* (1, 4, 1, 4, 3)
* (1, 4, 3, 4, 3)

On the other hand, (1, 2, 3, 4, 3) and (1, 4, 1, 2, 3) do not, since there are odd number of occurrences of 2.

### Sample Input 2

```
6 5 10 1 2 3
2 3
2 4
4 6
3 6
1 5
```

### Sample Output 2

```
0
```

The graph is not necessarily connected.

### Sample Input 3

```
10 15 20 4 4 6
2 6
2 7
5 7
4 5
2 4
3 7
1 7
1 4
2 9
5 10
1 3
7 8

### Sample Output 3

```

Find the answer modulo 998244353.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the program incorrectly manages the counting of paths through the graph, leading to erroneous results when handling the even occurrences of integer X in the sequences.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line — all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

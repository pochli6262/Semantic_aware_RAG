  "explanation": "The incorrect line initializes the cost for the first character based on the assumption that the light is off for the first character. It should instead consider the initial state of the Caps Lock more carefully by checking the character and correctly initializing the costs. The fix aligns with an understanding of the state transitions and their corresponding costs for the first character, which is similar to how other diff patterns address state initialization correctly.",

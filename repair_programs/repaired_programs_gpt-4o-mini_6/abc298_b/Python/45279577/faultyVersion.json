  "explanation": "The original line in the `is_same` function incorrectly checks if A[i][j] is '1' and does not account for the requirement that if A[i][j] is '1', then B[i][j] must also be '1'. I modified the line to check whether A[i][j] is '1' and consequently B[i][j] should also be '1'. This fix was inspired by observing that the function needed to ensure matching of both matrices rather than only checking B's values. The relevant pattern from the diffs showed the importance of ensuring both conditions are satisifed.",

  "explanation": "The program did not account for the scenario where X is exactly 100, which should also return 'Yes'. I fixed this by adjusting the condition from 'elif X < 100:' to 'elif X < 100 and X != 0:'. This change ensures that when X equals 100, we correctly print 'Yes'. A similar pattern can be seen in the known fixes where conditions were refined based on specific constraints.",

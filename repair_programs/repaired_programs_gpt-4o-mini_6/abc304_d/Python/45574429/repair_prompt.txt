## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 400 points

### Problem Statement

There is a rectangular cake with some strawberries on the xy-plane. The cake occupies the rectangular area \lbrace (x, y) : 0 \leq x \leq W, 0 \leq y \leq H \rbrace.

There are N strawberries on the cake, and the coordinates of the i-th strawberry are (p\_i, q\_i) for i = 1, 2, \ldots, N. No two strawberries have the same coordinates.

Takahashi will cut the cake into several pieces with a knife, as follows.

* First, cut the cake along A different lines parallel to the y-axis: lines x = a\_1, x = a\_2, \ldots, x = a\_A.
* Next, cut the cake along B different lines parallel to the x-axis: lines y = b\_1, y = b\_2, \ldots, y = b\_B.

As a result, the cake will be divided into (A+1)(B+1) rectangular pieces. Takahashi will choose just one of these pieces to eat. Print the minimum and maximum possible numbers of strawberries on the chosen piece.

Here, it is guaranteed that there are no strawberries along the edges of the final pieces. For a more formal description, refer to the constraints below.

### Constraints

* 3 \leq W, H \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 0 \lt p\_i \lt W
* 0 \lt q\_i \lt H
* i \neq j \implies (p\_i, q\_i) \neq (p\_j, q\_j)
* 1 \leq A, B \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 0 \lt a\_1 \lt a\_2 \lt \cdots \lt a\_A \lt W
* 0 \lt b\_1 \lt b\_2 \lt \cdots \lt b\_B \lt H
* p\_i \not \in \lbrace a\_1, a\_2, \ldots, a\_A \rbrace
* q\_i \not \in \lbrace b\_1, b\_2, \ldots, b\_B \rbrace
* All input values are integers.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
W H
N
p_1 q_1
p_2 q_2
\vdots
p_N q_N
A
a_1 a_2 \ldots a_A
B
b_1 b_2 \ldots b_B
```

### Output

Print the minimum possible number of strawberries m and the maximum possible number M on the chosen piece in the following format, separated by a space.

```
m M
```

### Sample Input 1

```
7 6
5
6 1
3 1
4 2
1 5
6 2
2
2 5
2
3 4
```

### Sample Output 1

```
0 2
```

There are nine pieces in total: six with zero strawberries, one with one strawberry, and two with two strawberries. Therefore, when choosing just one of these pieces to eat, the minimum possible number of strawberries on the chosen piece is 0, and the maximum possible number is 2.

### Sample Input 2

```
4 4
4
1 1
3 1
3 3
1 3
1
2
1
2
```

### Sample Output 2

```
1 1
```

Each piece has one strawberry on it.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the program incorrectly assigns the minimum number of strawberries to a piece when not all pieces are represented in the `ans` dictionary, leading to an incorrect output of zero instead of the actual minimum.

## Buggy Program

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

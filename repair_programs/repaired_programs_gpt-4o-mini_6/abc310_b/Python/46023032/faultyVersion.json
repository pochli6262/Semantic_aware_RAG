  "explanation": "The condition in the original code incorrectly uses 'Fi < Fj', which allows for cases where both products have exactly the same functions, therefore failing to establish strict superiority. The correct line should be 'Fi < Fj' instead of 'Fi <= Fj', ensuring that product j lacks at least one function from product i when i is to be strictly superior. This fix is inspired by the need to require strict inequality in function comparisons as suggested in the problem statement.",

  "explanation": "The original program had the variable `n` hardcoded as 10**12, which does not read the value of N from input, causing the output to be incorrect for different test cases. I changed this line to read from standard input with `n = int(input())`. This change aligns with typical problem-solving patterns where input needs to be dynamic based on user input, as seen in Diff 4.",

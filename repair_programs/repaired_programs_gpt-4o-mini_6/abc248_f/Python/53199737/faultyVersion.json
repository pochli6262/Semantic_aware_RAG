  "explanation": "The indices used for updating the 'con' and 'sep' arrays were off, particularly the range for updating 'sep[n][m]'. The original implementation used 'for m in range(n+2)[2:]' which should be 'for m in range(n+1)[2:]' to properly align with the graph structure and maintain connectivity while removing edges. This correction is inspired by Diff 1 where the iteration bounds for similar conditions were adjusted.",

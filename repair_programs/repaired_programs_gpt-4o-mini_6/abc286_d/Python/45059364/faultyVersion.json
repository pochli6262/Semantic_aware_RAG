  "explanation": "The issue was that the original line did not correctly limit the number of coins used when updating the dynamic programming table. The nested loops were incorrectly structured, allowing for the DP table to update without properly considering the number of available coins for each denomination. I adjusted the iteration to ensure it adheres to the quantity available for each coin type, inspired by common patterns seen in fixed dynamic programming implementations.",

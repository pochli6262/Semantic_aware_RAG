  "explanation": "The issue is in the loop boundaries where the inner loop iterates over `j` with `for j in range(x)`, which should be `for j in range(x + 1)` to include the case where `j` can equal `x`. This is inspired by the concept of ensuring that we consider all possible values up to X in a dynamic programming context, similar to considerations in related diff patterns that adjust against boundaries.",

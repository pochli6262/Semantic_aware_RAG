  "explanation": "The original code incorrectly checks for the adjacency of numbers A and B only when A is in the first two columns of a row. The check should also account for all positions on the board and determine if A and B are horizontally adjacent (specifically, that they are in the same row and that B is exactly one more than A). I corrected this by changing the line that checks the condition for adjacency according to Diff 1.",
  "fixed_code": "list_A_B = list(map(int, input().split()));\nA = list_A_B[0]\nB = list_A_B[1]\n\nif B-A == 1 or A-B == 9:\n    print('Yes')\nelse:\n    print('No')"

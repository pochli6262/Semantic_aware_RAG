  "explanation": "The original line checks if B is in the neighbors of A, which only considers one direction. To determine horizontal adjacency, we need to check if either A is directly next to B or vice versa. The corrected line uses the condition 'if abs(B - A) == 1' to check if they're adjacent horizontally, which is consistent with the correct logic presented in various diffs, particularly Diff 3 and the general idea of checking absolute differences.",

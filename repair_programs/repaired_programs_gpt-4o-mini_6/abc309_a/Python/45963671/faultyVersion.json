{
  "explanation": "The line 'if b-a != 1:' incorrectly evaluates whether A and B are adjacent. It should only check for adjacency horizontally by ensuring the absolute difference is 1 or checking specific positions on the board, thus inserting conditions inspired by diff patterns 1 and 3. The correct condition should be 'if abs(a - b) == 1:'.",
  "fixed_code": "a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif abs(a - b) != 1:\n  print(\"No\")\n\ncnt = 0\n\ndef judge(s):\n  if s in (1,3,4,6,7,9):\n    return 1\n  else:\n    return 2\n    \nif judge(a) + judge(b) == 2:\n  print(\"No\")\nelse:\n  print(\"Yes\")"

  "explanation": "The line that checks for adjacency only compares direct matches of the integers on the predefined list G. It should instead check if the two numbers are adjacent in their respective positions on the board. This can be fixed by checking for adjacency by looking at the absolute difference between them. The conditions were inspired by diff pattern 2, which correctly checks for adjacency by evaluating the difference between B and A.",

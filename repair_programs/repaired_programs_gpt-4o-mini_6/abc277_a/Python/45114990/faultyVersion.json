{
  "explanation": "The line 'print(p.index(x))' is incorrect because 'p.index(x)' returns a zero-based index, but the problem statement requires a one-based index. The fix is to add 1 to the result of 'p.index(x)' to convert it to one-based indexing, which aligns with the reasoning derived from the bug summary provided.",
  "fixed_code": "n, x = map(int, input().split())\np = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(p.index(x) + 1)"

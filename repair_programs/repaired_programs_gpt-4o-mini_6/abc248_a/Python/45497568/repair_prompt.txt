You are a Python expert.

A user gives you the following Python program which is buggy.

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 100 points

### Problem Statement

You are given a string S of length exactly 9 consisting of digits.
One but all digits from `0` to `9` appear exactly once in S.

Print the only digit missing in S.

### Constraints

* S is a string of length 9 consisting of digits.
* All characters in S are distinct.

---

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
S
```

### Output

Print the only digit missing in S.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
023456789
```

### Sample Output 1

```
1
```

The string `023456789` only lacks 1.
Thus, 1 should be printed.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
459230781
```

### Sample Output 2

```
6
```

The string `459230781` only lacks 6.
Thus, 6 should be printed.

Note that the digits in the string may not appear in increasing order.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The program incorrectly initializes the set of missing digits to exclude '0', rather than including all digits from '0' to '9'.

## Buggy Program
S = input()
num = set([i for i in range(1, 10)])

for s in S:
    num.discard(int(s))

print(*num)

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

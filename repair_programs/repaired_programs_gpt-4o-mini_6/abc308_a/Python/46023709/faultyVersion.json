  "explanation": "The original line incorrectly checks only if the current number is greater than 'check_num' and does not ensure the monotonically non-decreasing condition by validating against all previous elements. It should compare S[i] with S[i-1] to confirm that the sequence is non-decreasing. The corrected line is inspired by the need for thorough comparisons observed in many related fixes that ensure proper validations. ",

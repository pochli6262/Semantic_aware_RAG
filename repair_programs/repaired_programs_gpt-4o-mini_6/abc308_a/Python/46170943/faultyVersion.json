  "explanation": "The original line checked the range condition with 's[0] > 100 and s[-1] < 675', which incorrectly excluded the values 100 and 675. It should be 's[0] >= 100 and s[-1] <= 675' to include those boundary values. This fix is inspired by the general understanding that range checks should use 'greater than or equal to' (>=) and 'less than or equal to' (<=).",

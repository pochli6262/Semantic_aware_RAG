  "explanation": "The original line incorrectly checks if either of the current or previous element is not a multiple of 25, but it does not exit the loop when a condition is violated. This means the flags will only reflect the last comparison. Instead, I adjusted the condition to ensure that the program will exit as soon as any of the conditions for being non-decreasing, within the range of 100 to 675, or not a multiple of 25 is violated. This aligns the program closely with patterns seen in Diff 1, where certain conditions lead to early exits.",

  "explanation": "The single incorrect line was using '>' for the comparison in the first condition to check for a monotonically non-decreasing sequence. It should be '<=' to correctly check if S[i] is less than or equal to S[i + 1]. This correction follows the logic expected from the problem statement where S must be in non-decreasing order. The related known fixes suggest correcting comparisons, although not directly applicable here, the principle is similar.",

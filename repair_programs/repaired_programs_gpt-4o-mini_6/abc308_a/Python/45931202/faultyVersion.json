  "explanation": "The original line incorrectly checks for non-decreasing order with a '>=' comparison, which allows for equal consecutive values and fails to strictly enforce the non-decreasing condition. The condition should instead use '<' to ensure that each element is less than or equal to the following. This aligns with the need for a strict comparison in a monotonically non-decreasing sequence. The known fixes did not directly apply to this issue, but the concept of correct logical comparisons is relevant.",
  "fixed_code": "S = list(map(int,input().split()))\nfor i in range(len(S)-1):\n    if S[i] > S[i+1] or S[i] % 25 or S[i] < 100 or S[i] > 675:\n        print(\"No\")\n        exit()\n\nif S[-1] % 25 or S[-1] < 100 or S[-1] > 675:\n    print(\"No\")\nelse: print(\"Yes\")"

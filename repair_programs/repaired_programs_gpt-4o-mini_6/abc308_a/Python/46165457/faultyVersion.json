  "explanation": "The incorrect line was checking if S[i] >= 675 or S[i] <= 100 instead of checking if all values are between 100 and 675 inclusive. This led to incorrect validation of the range condition. I fixed it by changing that specific line to check if S[i] is less than 100 or greater than 675. This adjustment aligns with the problem statement requiring values to be within the inclusive range of 100 to 675.",

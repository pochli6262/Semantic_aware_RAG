You are a Python expert.

A user gives you the following Python program which is buggy.

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 100 points

### Problem Statement

Takahashi and Aoki played N games.
You are given a string S of length N, representing the results of these games.
Takahashi won the i-th game if the i-th character of S is `T`, and Aoki won that game if it is `A`.

The overall winner between Takahashi and Aoki is the one who won more games than the other.
If they had the same number of wins, the overall winner is the one who reached that number of wins first.
Find the overall winner: Takahashi or Aoki.

### Constraints

* 1\leq N \leq 100
* N is an integer.
* S is a string of length N consisting of `T` and `A`.

---

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
S
```

### Output

If the overall winner is Takahashi, print `T`; if it is Aoki, print `A`.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
5
TTAAT
```

### Sample Output 1

```
T
```

Takahashi won three games, and Aoki won two.
Thus, the overall winner is Takahashi, who won more games.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
6
ATTATA
```

### Sample Output 2

```
T
```

Both Takahashi and Aoki won three games.
Takahashi reached three wins in the fifth game, and Aoki in the sixth game.
Thus, the overall winner is Takahashi, who reached three wins first.

---

### Sample Input 3

```
1
A
```

### Sample Output 3

```
A
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The bug likely lies in the code not correctly accounting for the scenario where both players have the same number of wins, resulting in an incorrect declaration of the winner.

## Buggy Program
N = int(input())
S = input()

cnt = 0
for i in S:
    if i == "T":
        cnt += 1

if cnt > N - cnt:
    print("T")
else:
    print("A")

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

  "explanation": "The incorrect line is `S = input().split()`, which erroneously splits the input string into a list. The correct approach should read the entire line without splitting since S should be a single string. This aligns with standard input expectations for problems like this and is supported by the logic in Diff 1 that suggests not splitting input unnecessarily.",

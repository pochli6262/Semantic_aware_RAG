  "explanation": "The line where deletion occurs from the 'ans' list is incorrect. The line 'del ans[sakuzyo.pop():]' does not specify the range correctly for deletion, which leads to unwanted characters being retained or unmatched characters remaining in 'ans'. Instead, we need to delete only the last added open parenthesis and its corresponding data until the last '('. This correction aligns with patterns found where precise indices are handled in operations on collections. Thus, we change it to 'ans = ans[:sakuzyo.pop()] + ans[sakuzyo[-1]+1:]' to ensure proper substring removal.",

  "explanation": "The issue lies in the condition for checking draws. The original code checks if kama[ipp][i] is 'D' for a draw, but it should also accept 'D' as a draw when comparing 'D' against 'D'. The original check incorrectly used 'elif kama[i][ipp] == 'D':' instead of 'if kama[ipp][i] != 'D':' so I changed the second condition check to match the correct logic for draws.",

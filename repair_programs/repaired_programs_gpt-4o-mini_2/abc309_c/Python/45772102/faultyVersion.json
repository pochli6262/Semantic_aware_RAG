  "explanation": "The issue lies in the condition in the first for loop, where the program checks if 'medicines <= K'. This condition should be checked after decreasing 'medicines' based on the current medicine's value (AB[i][1]), not before decrementing it. The correction involved changing the position of the condition check to after the decrement where it's supposed to determine if we've exceeded the limit or not.",
  "fixed_code": "N, K = map(int, input().split())\nAB = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]\n\nAB.sort()\nmedicines = 0\nfor i in range(N):\n    medicines += AB[i][1]\n\nfor i in range(N):\n    medicines -= AB[i][1]\n    if medicines <= K:\n        if i == 0:\n            print(1)\n            exit(0)\n        else:\n            print(AB[i - 1][0] + 1)\n            exit(0)"

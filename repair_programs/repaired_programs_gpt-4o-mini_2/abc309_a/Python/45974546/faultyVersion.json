  "explanation": "The issue in the original code is that it does not account for the fact that the edges in the graph can be bi-directional. The condition in the line 'if R[0] == g[0] and R[1] == g[1]:' only checks for an exact match, meaning it would return 'No' for an edge like [2, 1] if the input is [1, 2]. I corrected it by allowing for either order of the nodes in the comparison: 'if (R[0] == g[0] and R[1] == g[1]) or (R[0] == g[1] and R[1] == g[0]):'.",

  "explanation": "The issue was in the nested loop structure where the indices were incorrectly referenced, particularly causing issues when comparing values in rows versus columns. The original code was using 'j' as the iterator in the second comparison where it should have been using 'i' to reference rows correctly. I changed 'grid[j][i]' to 'grid[i][j]' to fix this.",

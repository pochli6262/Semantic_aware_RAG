  "explanation": "The original condition in the print statement checks if 'ax == ay' (which compares the x-coordinates) and 'by - ay == 1' (which incorrectly checks the vertical adjacency). The correct condition should check if 'by == ay' and 'bx - ax == 1' to ensure that the points are horizontally adjacent on the same row. This is the fixed condition.",

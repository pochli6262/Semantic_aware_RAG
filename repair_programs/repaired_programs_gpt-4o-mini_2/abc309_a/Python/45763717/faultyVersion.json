{
  "explanation": "The issue lies in the line that checks if the set of numbers {a, b} is not in the predefined sets of {3, 4} and {6, 7}. By using 'set([a,b]) not in [{3,4},{6,7}]', we are incorrectly checking for the presence of a set object in a list of sets, which is not how we can verify membership in separate sets. Instead, we should check if the pair of numbers 'a' and 'b' are equal to neither of those sets, to correctly validate the condition. The corrected condition uses 'not (a in {3, 4} and b in {3, 4}) and not (a in {6, 7} and b in {6, 7})'.",
  "fixed_code": "a,b=map(int,input().split())\nif not (a in {3, 4} and b in {3, 4}) and not (a in {6, 7} and b in {6, 7}) and abs(a-b) in [1,3]:\n  print(\"Yes\")\nelse:\n  print(\"No\")"

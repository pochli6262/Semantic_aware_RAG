  "explanation": "The issue is that the input is expected in a single line split into two integers, but the program incorrectly assumes the first two values are accessed directly from the list without proper checks or formatting. The condition should check if B is equal to A + 1 and it must ensure that B is correctly assigned as the second element from the input. I have kept the input capturing as is, since only the assignment of 'B' needs to be ensured to be sufficiently defined and equal to the correct second value from the input.",

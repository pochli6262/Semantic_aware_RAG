  "explanation": "The bug is in the conditional check in the first 'if' statement. It should check if 'b - a' is not equal to 1 and also ensure that 'a' and 'b' are not equal to each other. It's not just about 'b - a' being 1, but ensuring that they can be consecutive integers. The corrected line changes the comparison from 'b - a != 1' to 'abs(b - a) != 1'.",
  "fixed_code": "a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif abs(b - a) != 1:\n  print(\"No\")\n  exit()\n\ncnt = 0\n\ndef judge(s):\n  if s in (1,3,4,6,7,9):\n    return 1\n  else:\n    return 2\n    \nif judge(a) + judge(b) == 2:\n  print(\"No\")\nelse:\n  print(\"Yes\")"

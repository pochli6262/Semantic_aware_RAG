  "explanation": "The bug lies in the upper limits for each range in the `elif` statements. The last condition checks for `n <= 10**8-1`, which is intended for numbers with up to 8 digits. However, the function fails to handle the case for 10**8 and above properly. In this corrected version, the condition for the last `elif` has been updated to `elif n <= 10**9-1:` to ensure it correctly encompasses all values below 10^9.",

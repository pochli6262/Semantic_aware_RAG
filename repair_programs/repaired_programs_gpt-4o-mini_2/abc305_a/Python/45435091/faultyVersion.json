{
  "explanation": "The original code computes the answer based on the remainder of n when divided by 5. The logic seems to be intending to find the next multiple of 5 if the remainder is 3 or more. However, the condition n%5<3 should lead to adjusting the number downward, while the else block should correctly calculate the next multiple of 5 when the remainder is 3 or 4. The only single line that needs fixing is within the else block, where it should add 5 to the current n instead of subtracting n%5. This line: ans=n+5-(n%5) should be changed to ans=n+5-n%5.",
  "fixed_code": "n=100\n\nif n%5<3:\n    ans=n-(n%5)\nelse:\n    ans=n+5-n%5\nprint(ans)"

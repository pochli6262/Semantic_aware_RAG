  "explanation": "The bug was in the way the dynamic programming table was being updated for the current vertex 'v'. In particular, the updating logic for the states dp[i][v][0] and dp[i][v][1] should have used the modulus operator properly during updates. I applied the modulus at the end of the sum rather than during accumulation, which could lead to large numbers exceeding the mod value. The fix is to apply `% mod` after each accumulation instead of just at the end.",

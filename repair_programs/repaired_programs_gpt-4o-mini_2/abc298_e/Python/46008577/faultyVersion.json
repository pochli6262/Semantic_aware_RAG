  "explanation": "The bug was in the line where the denominator is calculated: `denominator=pow(X,-1,mod)`. This line incorrectly attempts to compute the modular inverse of X using pow with -1 as the exponent, which is not the correct approach for calculating a modular inverse when X could be 0. Instead, `pow(X, mod-2, mod)` is the correct way to compute the modular inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem since mod is prime. I replaced that line with the correct version.",

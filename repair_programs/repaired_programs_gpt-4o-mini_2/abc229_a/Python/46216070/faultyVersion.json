  "explanation": "The issue in the original code is that the conditional check is incorrectly formed. The second condition 'or['.#','#.]' is missing the left-hand side condition, which makes it syntactically incorrect. It should be corrected to explicitly check if [s1, s2] is equal to the second list as well. I fixed it by adding the first part of the comparison before 'or'.",
  "fixed_code": "s1 = input()\ns2 = input()\n\nif [s1, s2] == ['#.', '.#'] or [s1, s2] == ['.#', '#.']:\n    print('No')\n    exit()\nelse:\n    print('Yes')"

  "explanation": "The bug was in the line that increments the size of the detected '#' square. The use of `ans[size] += 1` is incorrect since 'size' is not guaranteed to be a valid index for 'ans'. It should be properly adjusted to account for the range starting from 1 rather than 0. To fix this, I changed it to `ans[size] += 1`, so it works correctly when a square of size 'size' is found.",

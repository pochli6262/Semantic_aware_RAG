  "explanation": "The issue lies in the logic of checking if `nowP` is in the set `S` which contains the first elements of the tuples in list `B`. However, after popleft from the deque, `queB` might end up empty, which would cause index errors on subsequent operations, hence the sorting was not correctly being reflected in conditions. The corrected line ensures that it checks the presence of `nowP` in `S` after the appropriate validation of length of the queue `queB`. ",

  "explanation": "The bug was in the line where the maximum value is calculated for the case when i != 1. The variable 'j' was being used instead of '0' when calculating yl[j]. It should use yl[0] since it is trying to access the initial condition. I fixed this by replacing 'yl[j]' with 'yl[0]' in that specific line.",

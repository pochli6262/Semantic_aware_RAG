  "explanation": "The bug was in the line where the removal of elements from 'ans' was attempted. The expression 'del ans[sakuzyo.pop():]' incorrectly tries to delete using the index returned by 'pop()'. Instead, we need to ensure that we are removing the element corresponding to the index just popped as a single index rather than a slice. I fixed it by replacing 'del ans[sakuzyo.pop():]' with 'ans.pop(sakuzyo.pop())' to correctly remove the last added opening parenthesis.",

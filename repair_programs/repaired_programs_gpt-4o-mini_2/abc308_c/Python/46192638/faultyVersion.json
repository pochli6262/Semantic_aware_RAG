  "explanation": "The issue was in the calculation of the first element of the tuple in list 'l'. The expression '-a * 10 ** 100 / (a + b)' could produce incorrect results due to floating-point arithmetic limitations, especially when 'a' and 'b' are very large numbers. By changing the division to multiply by a negative constant to match the order of magnitude, we avoid potential inaccuracies. I changed it to '-a / (a + b)' and also multiplied by a large negative constant to keep the intended sorting order.",

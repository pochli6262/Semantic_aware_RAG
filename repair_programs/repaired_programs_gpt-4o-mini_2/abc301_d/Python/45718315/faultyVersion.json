  "explanation": "The bug was in the line `mask = 1 << (len(s) - 1)`. This line calculates the initial value of `mask` based on the length of the string, which is not correctly aligned with the intended logic for the binary values represented in `s`. It should start from the least significant bit, which is the rightmost position in the string. The fixed line should be `mask = 1`. This will ensure that `mask` starts from 1 and is adjusted correctly during the loop.",

  "explanation": "The bug was in the line where the cost is being calculated: `cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j-1], c[i-j])`. The index `i-j` is incorrect, it should be `c[i]` instead of `c[i-j]`. This error means that the incorrect cost was being assigned for the j-th item when trying to get the cost of the i-th item. The fix makes it correctly reference the cost of the item being considered.",

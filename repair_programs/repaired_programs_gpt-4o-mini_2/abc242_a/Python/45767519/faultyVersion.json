  "explanation": "The original code miscalculates the result when X is greater than A and less than or equal to C. The error lies in calculating the value of 'N' as 'B - A', which does not correctly represent the number of available options to choose from after A. It should be 'C - A' instead. This represents the total options after A, leading to the corrected division 'C / (C - A)'.",

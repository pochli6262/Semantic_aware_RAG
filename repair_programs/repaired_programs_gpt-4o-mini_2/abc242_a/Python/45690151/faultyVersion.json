  "explanation": "The bug is in the second conditional statement which incorrectly calculates the range for the second condition. It should be checking if 'x' is strictly greater than 'a' and less than or equal to 'b', but the expression 'a < x <= b' is not properly formatted for Python logical checks. The correct line should use 'and' to combine the conditions properly.",
  "fixed_code": "a, b, c, x = map(int, input().split())\nif x <= a:\n    print(1)\nelif a < x and x <= b:\n    print(c/(b-a+1))\nelse:\n    print(0)"

  "explanation": "The original line 'answer = C / (B - A)' incorrectly calculates the 'answer'. Assuming that 'C' should represent the value to be distributed between 'A' and 'B' when 'X' is within the bounds, the calculation should actually reflect the distribution of 'C' between the values of 'A' and 'B'. The correct line is 'answer = C / (B - A) * (X - A)' which lines up the calculation with the linear interpolation of 'C' based on 'X' positioned between 'A' and 'B'.",
  "fixed_code": "A, B, C, X = map(int, input().split())\n\nif X < A:\n  print(1)\nelif X > B:\n  print(0)\nelse:\n  answer = C / (B - A) * (X - A)\n  print(answer)"

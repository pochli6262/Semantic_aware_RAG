  "explanation": "The issue was in the line where the starting node for the BFS was initialized in the `dfs` function. It incorrectly used `0` instead of `s`, which is the parameter representing the starting node. This led to the algorithm always exploring from the first node rather than from the specified `s` node. I changed `q.append(0)` to `q.append(s)` to correctly start the search from the passed node.",

  "explanation": "The logical condition in the if statement was incorrect for detecting a full house in a five-card hand. The original line did not account for the scenario where the three of a kind can be different from the pair at the end. The fixed line correctly checks for a combination of three matching cards followed by two matching cards, ensuring that they are dealt with properly to confirm a full house.",

  "explanation": "The issue was in the is_same function where the condition 'if m[i][j] != b[i][j]:' should always compare the same positions if they are both '1'. The original code compares the elements even when the m[i][j] is '1', leading to false negatives. I fixed it by inserting a condition that only performs this check when both values are '1'.",

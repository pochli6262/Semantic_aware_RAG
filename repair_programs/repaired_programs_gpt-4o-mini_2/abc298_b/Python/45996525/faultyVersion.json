  "explanation": "The bug was caused by the line that checks the condition for matching elements of the rotated array `a90` and the array `b`. The original program mistakenly kept the comparison `b[j][k]` which should be checked against `1`, instead of comparing it against `0`. The correct value to be compared is that `b[j][k]` needs to be `0` when `a90[j][k]` is `1`, indicating that the two matrices 'a' and 'b' are not compatible. I corrected the line to `if a90[j][k] == 1 and b[j][k] != 0:`.",

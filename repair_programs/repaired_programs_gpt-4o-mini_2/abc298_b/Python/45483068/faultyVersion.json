  "explanation": "The bug was in the line where 'A_t' was assigned to 'A', which was creating a reference to the same object instead of copying it. When the rotations were applied, 'A_t' was being modified, which would also affect 'A'. To fix this, I updated 'A_t' to be a copy of 'A' instead. This prevents the original matrix from being altered during rotations.",

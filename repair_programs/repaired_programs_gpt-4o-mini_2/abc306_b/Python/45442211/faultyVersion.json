  "explanation": "The bug arises from the assumption that the input list A has at least 63 elements, which may not always be true. This leads to an IndexError if the input is shorter. I fixed it by limiting the loop to the length of list A instead of a hardcoded value of 63.",
  "fixed_code": "A = list(map(int,input().split()))\nS = 0\n\nimport math\n\nfor i in range(len(A)):\n    S = S + A[i]*(pow(2,i))\n    \nprint(S)"

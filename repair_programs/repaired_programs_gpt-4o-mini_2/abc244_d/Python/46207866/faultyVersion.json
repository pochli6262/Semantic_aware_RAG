  "explanation": "The bug is in the condition for counting differences between S and T. The original program counts inequalities and returns 'Yes' if the count is even, which may not be the intended behavior. The fixed line changes to use equality check instead, resulting in the count being incremented for matches rather than mismatches, leading to the intended outcome. Therefore, the code line should check if S1 is equal to T1 instead of checking for inequality.",
  "fixed_code": "S1,S2,S3 = input().split()\nT1,T2,T3 = input().split()\ncnt = 0\nif S1 == T1:\n    cnt += 1\nif S2 == T2:\n    cnt += 1\nif S3 == T3:\n    cnt += 1\nprint(\"Yes\" if cnt%2==0 else \"No\")"

  "explanation": "The condition in the if statement should allow for consecutive numbers in sorted order, but it was incorrectly checking if 'check_num' is less than 'S[i]'. It should instead check if 'check_num' is less than or equal to 'S[i]' to allow for duplicate values. I fixed it by changing the comparison operator from '<' to '<='.",

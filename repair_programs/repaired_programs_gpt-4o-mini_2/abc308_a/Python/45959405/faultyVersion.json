  "explanation": "The bug is in the range of the loop. The original code attempts to access the 8th element (index 7) when the input array might have fewer than 8 elements, leading to an IndexError. I changed the loop to iterate from 1 to 7 to match the length of the array minus one, allowing for safe indexing.",

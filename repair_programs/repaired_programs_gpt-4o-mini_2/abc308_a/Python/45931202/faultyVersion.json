  "explanation": "The bug in the program is in the conditional checks for S[i]. In the line 'if S[i] >= S[i+1] or S[i] % 25 or S[i] < 100 or S[i] > 675:', the checks for modulo and range need to be properly formatted to follow logical conditions. The correct condition should check if S[i] is NOT a multiple of 25, and to achieve this we should use 'S[i] % 25 != 0'. This ensures that the program correctly evaluates the condition for determining valid inputs. I modified the line to reflect that change.",
  "fixed_code": "S = list(map(int,input().split()))\nfor i in range(len(S)-1):\n    if S[i] >= S[i+1] or S[i] % 25 != 0 or S[i] < 100 or S[i] > 675:\n        print(\"No\")\n        exit()\n\nif S[-1] % 25 != 0 or S[-1] < 100 or S[-1] > 675:\n    print(\"No\")\nelse: print(\"Yes\")"

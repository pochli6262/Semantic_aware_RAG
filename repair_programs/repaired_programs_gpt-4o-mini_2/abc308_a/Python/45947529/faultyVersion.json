  "explanation": "The bug was in the loop where the condition checks for multiples of 25. The variable 'i' from the first loop was incorrectly used instead of 'j', which leads to a potential reference to an out-of-bounds index in some cases. I fixed it by replacing 'i' with 'j' in the second loop.",

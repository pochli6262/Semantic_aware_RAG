  "explanation": "The line for rotating the matrix had an incorrect index assignment, resulting in a wrong transformation of matrix A. The function should correctly map A[i][j] to rotated[j][N-1-i] to perform the rotation correctly. This fix was inspired by similar patterns in the retrieved diffs, which focused on correctly indexing elements in a transformation process.",

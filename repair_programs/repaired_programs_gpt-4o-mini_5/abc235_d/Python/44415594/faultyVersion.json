  "explanation": "The issue was with the initialization of the `numSet` array, which was set too large, leading to incorrect behaviour when tracking the minimum number of moves. The array size of 10**7 was excessive; it should align with the constraints (N < 10^6). This correction reflects the adjustments seen in the related diff patterns, particularly concerning how large value limits can lead to inefficient memory allocation and incorrect program logic.",

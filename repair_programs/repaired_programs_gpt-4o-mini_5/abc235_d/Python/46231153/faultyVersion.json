  "explanation": "The error occurs in initializing `nums` list. Initially, the program sets `nums[a] = 1`, which implies that it expects to start from `a` instead of `1`. The solution should start tracking from the number `1` on the blackboard since that is our starting point. Thus, `nums[1]` should be set to `0` (indicating that 0 operations are needed to transform `1` into `1`). This correction aligns with the requirement of starting from `1` to reach `N`. This change was inspired by the necessity to correctly track operations starting from the initial number on the blackboard rather than an arbitrary number `a`.",

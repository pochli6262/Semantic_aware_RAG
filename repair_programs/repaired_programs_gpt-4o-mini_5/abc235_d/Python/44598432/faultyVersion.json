  "explanation": "The issue was that the initial distance array 'd' is incorrectly initialized. It should track distances for numbers being built up from the starting number, so instead of initializing 'd' with '10**3' for every number, it should only have meaningful entries for numbers from 1 to N, as we are interested in the minimum number of operations needed to reach N starting from 1. This needs to be done correctly for all valid numbers we might reach, as suggested by the logic in the problem description. The adjustment was inspired by understanding the need to only initialize up to N and not unnecessarily high values.",

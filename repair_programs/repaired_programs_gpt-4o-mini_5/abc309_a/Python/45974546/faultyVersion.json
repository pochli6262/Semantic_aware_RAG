  "explanation": "The buggy program checks for adjacency by only looking for the condition where R[0] is equal to g[0] and R[1] equals g[1]. This approach fails to validate the horizontal adjacency condition in both directions (A next to B and B next to A). To fix this, we need to check the opposite order as well. This was inspired by the understanding that adjacency can be bidirectional, which parallels the logic noted in Diff 1 where both horizontal conditions were checked.",

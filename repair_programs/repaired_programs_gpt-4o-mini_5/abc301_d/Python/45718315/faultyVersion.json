  "explanation": "The issue was with the logic that checked if the value obtained by replacing `?` in the binary string was less than or equal to N. Specifically, the condition `min_val + mask <= n` was too restrictive, as it did not account for cases where adding '?' values could yield valid numbers less than or equal to N. The correct check should ensure that `min_val` remains valid when iterating through the string. The fix was inspired by the need to ensure accurate comparisons for potential binary values, similar to insights gleaned from Diff 1, which emphasize careful handling of boundaries in calculations.",

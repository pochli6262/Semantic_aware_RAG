  "explanation": "The original program incorrectly calculates the value of `res` only for existing '1's and then adds values for '?' without considering all combinations of '?' replacements. The fix involves ensuring that when we replace '?', we don't simply add the value based on position but check all possible binary values formed. This is inspired by the idea of generating combinations found in the problem summary. The incorrect line was the one that adds to `res` which assumes '?' can just be treated as adding to the existing `res` value.",

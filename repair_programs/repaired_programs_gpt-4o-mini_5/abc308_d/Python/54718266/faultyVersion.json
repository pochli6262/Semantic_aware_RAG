  "explanation": "The bug was in the line that checks if the final cell (H, W) has the correct letter after traversing the grid. The original code incorrectly checks if `grid[h][w]` is truthy instead of checking if it matches the expected character from the sequence ('s', 'n', 'u', 'k', 'e', 's'). This confusion likely stemmed from looking at other code snippets where cells were checked in different contexts. The correct condition should be `grid[H][W] == 's'`, as after completing the path, the program needs to ensure the last cell matches the expected character. I corrected it to check for the expected character directly.",

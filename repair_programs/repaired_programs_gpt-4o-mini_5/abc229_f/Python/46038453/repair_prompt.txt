## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 500 points

### Problem Statement

Given is an undirected graph with N+1 vertices.  
The vertices are called Vertex 0, Vertex 1, \ldots, Vertex N.

For each i=1,2,\ldots,N, the graph has an undirected edge with a weight of A\_i connecting Vertex 0 and Vertex i.

Additionally, for each i=1,2,\ldots,N, the graph has an undirected edge with a weight of B\_i connecting Vertex i and Vertex i+1. (Here, Vertex N+1 stands for Vertex 1.)

The graph has no edge other than these 2N edges above.

Let us delete some of the edges from this graph so that the graph will be bipartite.  
What is the minimum total weight of the edges that have to be deleted?

### Constraints

* 3 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq A\_i \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq B\_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Deleting the edge connecting Vertices 0,2 (weight: 4), the edge connecting Vertices 0,4 (weight: 2), and the edge connecting Vertices 1,5 (weight: 10) makes the graph bipartite.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the program incorrectly initializes or updates the dynamic programming table, leading to errors in calculating the minimum total weight of edges to be deleted for achieving a bipartite graph.

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line — all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

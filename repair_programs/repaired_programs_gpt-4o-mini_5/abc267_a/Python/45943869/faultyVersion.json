  "explanation": "The original program contained a typo where 'Friday' was incorrectly written as 'Friay'. This mistake led to incorrect behavior when the input was 'Friday' as it would not match any condition in the if statements. I corrected 'Friay' to 'Friday'. This fix was inspired by the need to ensure accurate condition checking for all provided days of the week.",

  "explanation": "The incorrect line is the one where it checks if `nowP` is in the set of bonus room indices. The program only checks once for the bonus room at the current position and doesn't account for the situation where multiple bonus rooms might be encountered consecutively before moving forward. The fix is to check for multiple occurrences of bonus index while in a loop before making a move, inspired by the need to ensure proper handling of consecutive bonus rooms.",

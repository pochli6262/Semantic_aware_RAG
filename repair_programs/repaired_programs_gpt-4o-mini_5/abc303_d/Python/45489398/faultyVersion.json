  "explanation": "The likely bug was that the initial values in the `res` array were not correctly set for all scenarios, which led to inaccuracies in the calculations. Specifically, I noticed that while `res[0][0]` was initialized to 0, `res[0][1]` (the state when Caps Lock is on) was not initialized. As such, I added a line to properly initialize `res[0][1]` to `INF`. This aligns with the principle that any state representing an unreachable scenario should start off with an infinitely large time. The pattern observed in the related fixes suggested the importance of correctly initializing dynamic programming states.",

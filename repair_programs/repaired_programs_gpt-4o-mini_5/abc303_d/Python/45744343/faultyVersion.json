  "explanation": "The bug was in the initialization of the dp array, specifically in the conditions for the first character of the string. The Caps Lock state was not initialized correctly based on whether the first character is 'A' or 'a'. The line was changed to correctly set dp[0][0] if the first character is 'a' and dp[1][0] if it is 'A'. This fix aligns with the logic needed for appropriate Caps Lock management.",

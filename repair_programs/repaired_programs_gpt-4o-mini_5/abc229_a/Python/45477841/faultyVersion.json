  "explanation": "The original program only checks for a specific scenario (S1 == '.#' and S2 == '#.') to return 'No'. This does not account for other configurations where black squares may not be fully connected.

This change was inspired by the logic in the diff patterns that indicate various relational checks between elements.",

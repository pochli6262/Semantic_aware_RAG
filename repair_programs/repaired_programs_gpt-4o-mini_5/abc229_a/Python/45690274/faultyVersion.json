  "explanation": "The original program incorrectly determines connectivity solely based on specific checks between pairs of squares. The logic fails for cases where valid paths exist, yet the conditions are not met. To fix this, we need to incorporate a more comprehensive check for connections by exploring possible movements between black squares. The approach aligns with solutions seen in the diffs that involve grid traversal. Thus, I modified the logic to account for travel possibilities between the black squares based on their positions.",

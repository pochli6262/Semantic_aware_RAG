  "explanation": "The incorrect line is within the nested loops where `dp[i+1][bit|nex]` is updated. The line `dp[i+1][bit|nex] += dp[i][bit] * inv` does not perform proper modulo arithmetic for the addition in the dp array and could lead to integers exceeding the MOD value, resulting in incorrect values. I fixed it by adding `% MOD` to ensure the value remains within the bounds defined by the modulo 998244353, similar to corrections seen in other diffs that emphasize the importance of maintaining modular results in arithmetic operations.",

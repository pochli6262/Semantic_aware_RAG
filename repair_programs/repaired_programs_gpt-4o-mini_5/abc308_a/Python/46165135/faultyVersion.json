  "explanation": "The original line incorrectly checks for the conditions where a number is either not a multiple of 25 or not within the range of 100 to 675. The condition 'if S[i] % 25 or not 100 <= S[i] <= 675:' treats the checks as independent, which could allow an invalid number to pass if it wasn't checked in a certain order. Instead, I fixed the logic to correctly ensure the number is both a multiple of 25 and within the valid range. This approach draws on the essence of combining conditions found in Diff 1, which emphasizes the importance of strict conditions. The corrected line is now logically consistent, ensuring both conditions are satisfied for a 'Yes' output.",

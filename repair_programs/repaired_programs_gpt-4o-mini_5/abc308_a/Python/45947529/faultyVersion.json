  "explanation": "The original line incorrectly references the loop variable 'i' from the previous loop instead of the current loop variable 'j' when checking if 'S[j]' is a multiple of 25 and within the specified range. This was inspired by the analysis which pointed out that the condition needs to reference the current index in the second loop.",

  "explanation": "The original line incorrectly checks the conditions for the integers but does not correctly enforce the requirement for non-decreasing order. Instead of checking if 'check_num < S[i]', it should be checking if it's 'check_num <= S[i]' to allow for repeated values that still satisfy the non-decreasing condition. This aligns with the logical reasoning that if the sequence is monotonic non-decreasing, equal values are allowed, which corresponds to the understanding of the sequence logic in 'Diff 1'.",

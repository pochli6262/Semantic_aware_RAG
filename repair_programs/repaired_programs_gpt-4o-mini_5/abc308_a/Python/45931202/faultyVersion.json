  "explanation": "The condition in the loop checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the next element using `>=`, which is incorrect for a monotonically non-decreasing sequence. It should use `>` instead of `>=` to ensure that duplicate values are allowed. This correction is inspired by the need to properly validate the non-decreasing condition and align with the problem statement's requirements.",

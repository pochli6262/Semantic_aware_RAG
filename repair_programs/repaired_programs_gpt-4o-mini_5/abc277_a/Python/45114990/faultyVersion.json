{
  "explanation": "The original program uses the zero-based index from the `list.index()` method, which returns the index of element `x` in the list `p`. However, the problem requires a one-based index. Therefore, I corrected the program by adding 1 to the result of `p.index(x)`. This aligns with the problem statement that expects the output in a one-based format. The fix was inspired by similar issues in other diffs where indexing was corrected to output the right values.",
  "fixed_code": "n, x = map(int, input().split())\np = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint(p.index(x) + 1)"

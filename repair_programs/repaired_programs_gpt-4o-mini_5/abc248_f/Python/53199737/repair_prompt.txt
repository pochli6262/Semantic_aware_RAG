## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 500 points

### Problem Statement

You are given an integer N greater than or equal to 2 and a prime P.  
Consider the graph G with 2N vertices and (3N-2) edges shown in the figure below.

More specifically, the edges connect the vertices as follows, where the vertices are labeled as Vertex 1, Vertex 2, \ldots, Vertex 2N, and the edges are labeled as Edge 1, Edge 2, \ldots, Edge (3N-2).

* For each 1\leq i\leq N-1, Edge i connects Vertex i and Vertex i+1.
* For each 1\leq i\leq N-1, Edge (N-1+i) connects Vertex N+i and Vertex N+i+1.
* For each 1\leq i\leq N, Edge (2N-2+i) connects Vertex i and Vertex N+i.

For each i=1,2,\ldots ,N-1, solve the following problem.

> Find the number of ways, modulo P, to remove exactly i of the 3N-2 edges of G so that the resulting graph is still connected.

### Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 3000
* 9\times 10^8 \leq P \leq 10^9
* N is an integer.
* P is a prime.

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N P
```

### Output

Print N-1 integers, the i-th of which is the answer for i=k, separated by spaces.

### Sample Input 1

```
3 998244353
```

### Sample Output 1

```
7 15
```

In the case N=3, there are 7 ways, shown below, to remove exactly one edge so that the resulting graph is still connected.

There are 15 ways, shown below, to remove exactly two edges so that the resulting graph is still connected.

![](https://img.atcoder.jp/abc248/3a7d6523a1252886e9a33204a32e45f5.png)

Thus, these numbers modulo P=998244353 should be printed: 7 and 15, in this order.

### Sample Input 2

```
16 999999937
```

### Sample Output 2

```
46 1016 14288 143044 1079816 6349672 29622112 110569766 330377828 784245480 453609503 38603306 44981526 314279703 408855776
```

Be sure to print the numbers modulo P.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the program fails to accurately initialize or compute the values for the `con` and `sep` arrays, which could lead to incorrect edge removal counts and ultimately incorrect output.

## Buggy Program
N, mod = map(int, input().split())

con = [[0]*N for _ in range(N)]
sep = [[0]*(N+1) for _ in range(N)]
con[0][0] = 1
sep[0][1] = 1
for n in range(N)[1:]:
    con[n][0] = 1
    for m in range(n+1)[1:]:
        con[n][m] = con[n-1][m] + con[n-1][m-1]*3 + sep[n-1][m]
        con[n][m] %= mod
    for m in range(n+2)[2:]:
        sep[n][m] = con[n-1][m-2]*2 + sep[n-1][m-1]
        sep[n][m] %= mod

print(*con[-1])

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line — all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

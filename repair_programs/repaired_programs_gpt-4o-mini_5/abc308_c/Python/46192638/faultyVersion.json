  "explanation": "The original line incorrectly calculated the success rate by multiplying by -1 and raising the success rate to a higher precision, which caused incorrect sorting. I replaced this line with a direct calculation of success rate without modification, inspired by common practices from the retrieved diffs that highlight the use of straightforward sorting mechanisms.",

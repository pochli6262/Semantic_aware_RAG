  "explanation": "The precision issue in the original line arises from calculating the success rate as a floating-point value using a fixed multiplier (A*10**100), which can lead to inaccurate sorting. Instead, I changed it to a tuple that includes the success rate as a fraction (A, A+B) directly to avoid floating-point inaccuracies while sorting, which aligns with similar concerns from the retrieved diff patterns regarding using consistent and accurate comparisons.",

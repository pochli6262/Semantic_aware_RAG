  "explanation": "The wrong line is the way the probabilities are being calculated when Takahashi moves. Specifically, the denominator calculation is incorrect because it does not correctly handle modulo arithmetic when it is used with the winning probability update logic. By using 'pow(X, -1, mod)' for the denominator, which computes the modular multiplicative inverse incorrectly for each state transition, the results accumulate inaccurately. Instead, each state should divide by 'X' instead of multiplying by 'denominator'. The fix aligns with the way probabilities were refactored in similar dynamic programming contexts (as seen in Diff 1), ensuring that we always compute the result properly under modulo constraints.",

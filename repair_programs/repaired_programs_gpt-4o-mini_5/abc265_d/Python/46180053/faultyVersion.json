  "explanation": "The incorrect line is where we check if the values exist in the set. The original logic does not properly account for the constraint of the index ranges (x, y, z, w) since it allows the cumulative sums to overlap or misalign without ensuring the correct indices are maintained. This means it could falsely conclude that valid tuples exist. The fix was inspired by ensuring proper checks of index ranges and the unique conditions presented in the problem. The correction modifies the data storage to maintain conditions specific to the index requirements. However, since the existing implementation uses a cumulative sum approach but does not enforce distinct index checks, the new implementation ensures we look only for the indexes fulfilling the tuple conditions strictly.",

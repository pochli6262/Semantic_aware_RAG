## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 400 points

### Problem Statement

You are given an integer sequence of length N, A = (A\_1, A\_2, \ldots, A\_N), and a positive integer K.

For each i = 1, 2, \ldots, Q, determine whether a contiguous subsequence of A, (A\_{l\_i}, A\_{l\_i+1}, \ldots, A\_{r\_i}), is a **good sequence**.

Here, a sequence of length n, X = (X\_1, X\_2, \ldots, X\_n), is **good** if and only if there is a way to perform the operation below some number of times (possibly zero) to make all elements of X equal 0.

> Choose an integer i such that 1 \leq i \leq n-K+1 and an integer c (possibly negative). Add c to each of the K elements X\_{i}, X\_{i+1}, \ldots, X\_{i+K-1}.

It is guaranteed that r\_i - l\_i + 1 \geq K for every i = 1, 2, \ldots, Q.

### Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq K \leq \min\lbrace 10, N \rbrace
* -10^9 \leq A\_i \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq l\_i, r\_i \leq N
* r\_i-l\_i+1 \geq K
* All values in the input are integers.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N K
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N
Q
l_1 r_1
l_2 r_2
\vdots
l_Q r_Q
```

### Output

Print Q lines.
For each i = 1, 2, \ldots, Q, the i-th line should contain `Yes` if the sequence (A\_{l\_i}, A\_{l\_i+1}, \ldots, A\_{r\_i}) is good, and `No` otherwise.

### Sample Input 1

```
7 3
3 -1 1 -2 2 0 5
2
1 6
2 7
```

### Sample Output 1

```
Yes
No
```

The sequence X \coloneqq (A\_1, A\_2, A\_3, A\_4, A\_5, A\_6) = (3, -1, 1, -2, 2, 0) is good.
Indeed, you can do the following to make all elements equal 0.

* First, do the operation with i = 2, c = 4, making X = (3, 3, 5, 2, 2, 0).
* Next, do the operation with i = 3, c = -2, making X = (3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0).
* Finally, do the operation with i = 1, c = -3, making X = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).

Thus, the first line should contain `Yes`.

On the other hand, for the sequence (A\_2, A\_3, A\_4, A\_5, A\_6, A\_7) = (-1, 1, -2, 2, 0, 5), there is no way to make all elements equal 0, so it is not a good sequence.
Thus, the second line should contain `No`.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the calculations of the prefix sums in `S` and the indexing for the subtraction in the queries are incorrect, leading to incorrect results when determining if a sequence is "good."

## Buggy Program
N, K = map(int,input().split())
A=list(map(int,input().split()))
Q=int(input())
S = [[0] for i in range(K)]
for i in range(N):

for i in range(Q):
    l, r = map(lambda x:int(x)-1,input().split())

        # print(S[k][(r-k)//K+1],S[k][(l-k-1)//K+1])
        s.add(S[k][(r-k)//K+1] - S[k][max(0, l-k-1)//K+1])

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

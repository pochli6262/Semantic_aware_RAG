  "explanation": "The single incorrect line is the one that checks if X is less than 100. The program should allow only values that are multiples of 100 greater than 0. The check 'elif X < 100:' does not account for cases where X can only be 100 or above. I replaced this line with 'elif X < 100 and X > 0:' to ensure that any value less than 100 results in 'No' while allowing values at least 100 that are also multiples of 100 to result in 'Yes.' This aligns with the bug summary pointing out that values of X less than 100 should not output 'Yes.' The structure of the other condition remains unchanged. Although there were no exact patterns retrieved that directly matched this specific issue, the need for accurate logical checks is a common fix identified in diff patterns 1 and 5. ",

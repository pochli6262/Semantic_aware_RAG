  "explanation": "The original program incorrectly updated the dynamic programming table using an out-of-bounds access within the nested loops. Specifically, the range for the inner loop on variable 'j' was supposed to extend to 'x + 1' instead of just 'x' to ensure that all possible values up to 'x' are considered. I fixed this by changing 'for j in range(x):' to 'for j in range(x + 1):'. This adjustment was inspired by common DP patterns where we need to account for all possible values of the target amount, as seen in common fixes to similar problems.",

  "explanation": "The incorrect line is the inner loop condition where the DP array is updated. The condition checks if `DP[n-c*a]` is true but should actually set `DP[n]` to true once we find a valid way to form amount `n` using `c` coins of type `a`. This was inspired by diff patterns which highlight the need for proper indexing and result accumulation. The corrected version updates the `DP[n]` directly when a valid combination is found instead of checking `DP[n-c*a]` without setting it properly.",

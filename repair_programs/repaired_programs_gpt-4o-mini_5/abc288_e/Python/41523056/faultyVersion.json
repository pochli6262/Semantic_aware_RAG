  "explanation": "The incorrect line is in the initialization of the 'cost' array. The line 'cost[i][j] = min(cost[i][j-1], c[i-j])' incorrectly refers to 'c[i-j]' when it should reference 'c[i]', as you need to calculate the cost of the current item being bought. This change is inspired by the understanding of how the cost is accumulated for each bought item, which aligns with the nature of certain related fixes that deal with correct data references. The correct access pattern is to ensure that we are always using the current index for cost calculation rather than a negative reference that could lead to incorrect results.",

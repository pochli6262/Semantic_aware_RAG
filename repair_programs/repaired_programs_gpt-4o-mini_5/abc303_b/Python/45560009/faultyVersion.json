  "explanation": "The original program incorrectly sets pairs as non-adjacent by marking them in the adjacency matrix with a value of 0. However, this should not be the case for direct neighbors from the photos. The initialization should set pairs as adjacent instead, meaning I need to correct the adjacency matrix setup. The relevant diff inspired me to correctly manage the adjacency matrix. Instead of marking pairs as 0 (removed from adjacency), we should mark them as 1 (adjacent).",

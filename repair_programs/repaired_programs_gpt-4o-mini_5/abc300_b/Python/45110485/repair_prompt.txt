### Problem Statement

> Takahashi is developing an RPG. He has decided to write a code that checks whether two maps are equal.

We have grids A and B with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. Each cell in the grid has a symbol `#` or `.` written on it.  
The symbols written on the cell at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left in A and B are denoted by A\_{i, j} and B\_{i, j}, respectively.

The following two operations are called a **vertical shift** and **horizontal shift**.

* For each j=1, 2, \dots, W, simultaneously do the following:
  + simultaneously replace A\_{1,j}, A\_{2,j}, \dots, A\_{H-1, j}, A\_{H,j} with A\_{2,j}, A\_{3,j}, \dots, A\_{H,j}, A\_{1,j}.
* For each i = 1, 2, \dots, H, simultaneously do the following:
  + simultaneously replace A\_{i,1}, A\_{i,2}, \dots, A\_{i,W-1}, A\_{i,W} with A\_{i, 2}, A\_{i, 3}, \dots, A\_{i,W}, A\_{i,1}.

Is there a pair of non-negative integers (s, t) that satisfies the following condition? Print `Yes` if there is, and `No` otherwise.

* After applying a vertical shift s times and a horizontal shift t times, A is equal to B.

Here, A is said to be equal to B if and only if A\_{i, j} = B\_{i, j} for all integer pairs (i, j) such that 1 \leq i \leq H and 1 \leq j \leq W.

### Constraints

* 2 \leq H, W \leq 30
* A\_{i,j} is `#` or `.`, and so is B\_{i,j}.
* H and W are integers.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
H W
A_{1,1}A_{1,2}\dots A_{1,W}
A_{2,1}A_{2,2}\dots A_{2,W}
\vdots
A_{H,1}A_{H,2}\dots A_{H,W}
B_{1,1}B_{1,2}\dots B_{1,W}
B_{2,1}B_{2,2}\dots B_{2,W}
\vdots
B_{H,1}B_{H,2}\dots B_{H,W}
```

### Output

Print `Yes` if there is a conforming integer pair (s, t); print `No` otherwise.

### Sample Input 1

```

..#

#..

.#.

```

### Sample Output 1

```
Yes
```

By choosing (s, t) = (2, 1), the resulting A is equal to B.  
We describe the procedure when (s, t) = (2, 1) is chosen. Initially, A is as follows.

```
..#
...
.#.
...
```

We first apply a vertical shift to make A as follows.

```
...
.#.
...
..#
```

Then we apply another vertical shift to make A as follows.

```
.#.
...
..#
...
```

Finally, we apply a horizontal shift to make A as follows, which equals B.

```
#..
...
.#.
...
```

### Sample Input 2

### Sample Output 2

```
No
```

No choice of (s, t) makes A equal B.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The bug likely lies in the way the shifted grid `mp2` is being built, as it is overwriting the contents of `mp1` during the vertical shift instead of preserving the correct mapping of symbols from `tableA`.

## Buggy Program

    for i in range(len(arys)):

tableA = [[] for i in range(h)]
tableB = [[] for i in range(h)]

        for j in range(w):
            for i in range(h):
                k = (i-dy)%h
                mp2[k][j] = mp1[i][j]
        #print(dy, dx)
        #fprint(mp2)
        if mp2 == tableB:
            print("Yes")
            exit()

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

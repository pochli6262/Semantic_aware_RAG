  "explanation": "The issue lies in how the vertical shift operates when updating 'mp1'. It uses the original 'tableA' to map symbols to 'mp1' while 'mp1' should correctly reference 'mp2' during its construction to prevent overwriting the already adjusted values. Thus, while copying over values, we need to ensure we read from 'tableA' correctly, while also retaining the state of 'mp1' for the vertical application. The request aligns with the patterns seen in Diff 1, which emphasizes the manipulation of lists in a synchronized manner without overwriting necessary elements. Therefore, I modified the initialization of 'mp1' to reference 'tableA' directly during the vertical shift construction step.",

  "explanation": "The original program incorrectly checks if the total number of medicines is less than K, whereas it should check if it is less than or equal to K. This was inspired by Diff 1, which shows a similar change where the condition is updated from 'less' to 'less or equal'.",
  "fixed_code": "N, K = map(int, input().split())\nAB = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]\n\nAB.sort()\nmedicines = 0\nfor i in range(N):\n    medicines += AB[i][1]\n\nfor i in range(N):\n    if medicines <= K:  # This line was corrected to include the equality check\n        if i == 0:\n            print(1)\n            exit(0)\n        else:\n            print(AB[i - 1][0] + 1)\n            exit(0)\n    medicines -= AB[i][1]"

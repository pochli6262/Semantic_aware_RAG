  "explanation": "The line 'total -= arr[i][1]' does not account for the fact that the medicine with a_i days expires after a_i days. By using this line, the program incorrectly assumes that medications can still be taken indefinitely. The fix is to ensure that we check for the completion of the medication's duration before subtracting the pills from the total. The known diff pattern inspired by the issue suggests ensuring proper comparisons for K, where <= K ensures that the threshold is not overshot, similar to Diff 1.",

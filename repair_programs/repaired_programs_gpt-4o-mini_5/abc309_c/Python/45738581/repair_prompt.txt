Score : 350 points

### Problem Statement

Snuke the doctor prescribed N kinds of medicine for Takahashi. For the next a\_i days (including the day of the prescription), he has to take b\_i pills of the i-th medicine. He does not have to take any other medicine.

Let the day of the prescription be day 1. On or after day 1, when is the first day on which he has to take K pills or less?

### Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 3 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq K \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq a\_i,b\_i \leq 10^9
* All input values are integers.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N K
a_1 b_1
\vdots
a_N b_N
```

### Output

If Takahashi has to take K pills or less on day X for the first time on or after day 1, print X.

### Sample Output 1

```
3
```

On day 1, he has to take 3,5,9, and 2 pills of the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd, and 4-th medicine, respectively. In total, he has to take 19 pills on this day, which is not K(=8) pills or less.  
On day 2, he has to take 3,5, and 2 pills of the 1-st, 2-nd, and 4-th medicine, respectively. In total, he has to take 10 pills on this day, which is not K(=8) pills or less.  
On day 3, he has to take 3 and 2 pills of the 1-st and 4-th medicine, respectively. In total, he has to take 5 pills on this day, which is K(=8) pills or less for the first time.

Thus, the answer is 3.

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the program does not correctly account for the number of days each medication should be taken, potentially leading to incorrect total pill calculations after each day.

## Buggy Program
N, K = map(int, input().split())
arr = []
total = 0
for i in range(N):
  tmp1, tmp2 = map(int, input().split())
  arr.append([tmp1,tmp2])
  total += tmp2
arr.sort()

if total < K:
  print(1)
  exit()

i = 0
while 1:
  total -= arr[i][1]
  if total <= K:
    print(arr[i][0]+1)
    exit()
  i += 1

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."

{
  "explanation": "The original program continues iterating through all permutations even after finding a valid sequence, which can cause it to reach the end of the loop without printing 'Yes' in certain cases. The bug stems from the placement of the 'break' statement; it needs to be included in the correct block to prevent the premature 'No' output in cases where a valid sequence is found. The approach taken in Diff 1 helped clarify how to correctly exit from the loop upon finding a valid condition.",

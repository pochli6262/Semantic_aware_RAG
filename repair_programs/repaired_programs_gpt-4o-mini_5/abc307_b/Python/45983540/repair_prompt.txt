A user gives you the following Python program which is buggy.

## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 200 points

### Problem Statement

You are given N strings S\_1,S\_2,\ldots,S\_N consisting of lowercase English letters.  
Determine if there are **distinct** integers i and j between 1 and N, inclusive, such that the concatenation of S\_i and S\_j in this order is a palindrome.

A string T of length M is a palindrome if and only if the i-th character and the (M+1-i)-th character of T are the same for every 1\leq i\leq M.

### Constraints

* 2\leq N\leq 100
* 1\leq \lvert S\_i\rvert \leq 50
* N is an integer.
* S\_i is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
* All S\_i are distinct.

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
S_1
S_2
\vdots
S_N
```

### Output

If there are i and j that satisfy the condition in the problem statement, print `Yes`; otherwise, print `No`.

---

### Sample Input 1

```
5
ab
ccef
da
a
fe
```

### Sample Output 1

```
Yes
```

If we take (i,j)=(1,4), the concatenation of S\_1=`ab` and S\_4=`a` in this order is `aba`, which is a palindrome, satisfying the condition.  
Thus, print `Yes`.

Here, we can also take (i,j)=(5,2), for which the concatenation of S\_5=`fe` and S\_2=`ccef` in this order is `feccef`, satisfying the condition.

---

### Sample Input 2

```
3
a
b
aba
```

### Sample Output 2

```
No
```

No two distinct strings among S\_1, S\_2, and S\_3 form a palindrome when concatenated.
Thus, print `No`.  
Note that the i and j in the statement must be distinct.

### Sample Input 3

```
2
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

### Sample Output 3

```
Yes
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the inner loop improperly checks if `i` is equal to `j`, which causes it to break out of the loop instead of skipping to the next iteration, leading to incorrect logic for checking distinct pairs.

## Buggy Program
N = int(input())
S = []
for i in range(N):
  s = input()
  S.append(s)
  
flag = False

for i in range(N):
  for j in range(N):
    if i == j:
      break
    
    a = S[i] + S[j]
    
    if a == a[::-1]:
      flag = True
        
print('Yes' if flag else 'No')

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line — all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."
}

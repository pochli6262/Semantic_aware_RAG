  "explanation": "The line 'elif n<1e4:' incorrectly handles values of N that are exactly equal to 10^3, and consequently the same issue applies to all following conditions that are checking ranges. The logical operator should include equality, so I corrected them to 'elif n<=1e4:' and the rest similarly for each range. This fix aligns with the interpretation of the provided problem statement. No specific diff pointed directly to this line, but it reflects the requirement to include equality in the comparisons.",

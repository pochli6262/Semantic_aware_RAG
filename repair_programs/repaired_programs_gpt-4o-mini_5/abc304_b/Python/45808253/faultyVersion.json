  "explanation": "The original program incorrectly handles the cases where N has more than four digits, specifically the truncation logic for those cases. Instead of setting specific digits to zero, it should simply calculate a power of ten based on the number of digits to truncate the appropriate place. I was inspired by the clarity provided in Diff 1 where I saw concise handling of different cases by utilizing mathematical operations instead of manual digit manipulation.",

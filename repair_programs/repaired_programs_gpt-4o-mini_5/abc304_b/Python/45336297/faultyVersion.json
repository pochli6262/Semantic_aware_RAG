  "explanation": "The line that computes the truncation was incorrect for the highest boundary condition of N. The original logic used 'elif n <= 10**8-1:' without a corresponding case for when N is exactly 10**8, failing to handle the last range correctly. For this reason, I fixed the line to ensure that it correctly rounds down for values that meet the exact threshold by checking 'elif n <= 10**8:' instead. This adjustment is similar to fixes seen in the related diffs where precise thresholds are taken into account.",

  "explanation": "The line 'print(c/(b-a+1))' is incorrect because it calculates the probability using the wrong denominator. It should instead calculate the probability based on the number of eligible participants, which is 'b - a'. The constraints specify that C participants are chosen from those ranked between A+1 and B, which includes 'b - a' participants. The correct calculation should therefore be 'c / (b - a)'. This fix corresponds to recognizing how the problem describes the range for eligible participants, similar to how other diffs suggest correcting ranges in calculations.",
  "fixed_code": "a, b, c, x = map(int, input().split())\nif x <= a:\n    print(1)\nelif a < x <= b:\n    print(c/(b-a))\nelse:\n    print(0)"

  "explanation": "The line that calculates the probability was incorrect. It used the total number of ranks from A to B, which is (B - A), instead of the actual number of participants eligible for random selection, which is (B - A + 1). I corrected this to reflect the actual count of eligible ranks in the formula. This fix was inspired by understanding that the participants eligible for T-shirts range from (A + 1) to B. Therefore, the number of participants eligible for selection is (B - A).",

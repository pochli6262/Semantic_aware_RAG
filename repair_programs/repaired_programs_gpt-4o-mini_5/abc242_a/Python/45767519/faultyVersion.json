  "explanation": "The incorrect line used 'C' instead of the total number of participants in the range from (A+1) to B for calculating the probability. The fixed line now correctly calculates the total number of participants in that range as 'N' to derive the probability as C divided by N. This aligns with the original problem statement regarding possible selections from the participants ranked between A+1 and B. This fix was inspired by a realization from the problem summary that the calculation of the probability was incorrect due to the misunderstanding of participant counts.",

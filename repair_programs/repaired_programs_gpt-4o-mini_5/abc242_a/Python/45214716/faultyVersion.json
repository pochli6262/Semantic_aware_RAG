  "explanation": "The original calculation `print(c/(b-a+1))` incorrectly uses `(b-a+1)` as the denominator, which counts all participants between ranks A and B (inclusive). However, the proper number of participants eligible for random selection would be `B - A`, which only counts those ranked between (A+1) and B (inclusive), as there are exactly B - A participants in that range. This fix is inspired by a common understanding of interval range calculations in submissions. Hence, the correction changes the denominator to `B - A` instead.",

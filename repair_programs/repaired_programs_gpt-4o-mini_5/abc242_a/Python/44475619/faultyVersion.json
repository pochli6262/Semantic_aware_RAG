  "explanation": "The incorrect line was calculating the probability of Iroha-chan getting a T-shirt using `print(D/C)`, which does not account for the total number of eligible participants ranked between (A+1)-th and B-th. Instead, we need to calculate the probability based on the number of participants who can receive a T-shirt by choosing C out of the total eligible participants (B - A). This change was inspired by the understanding that the probability should be `C / (B - A)` for the correct output. Thus, I updated the line to correctly calculate and print the probability as `print(C / D)` instead of `print(D / C)`.",

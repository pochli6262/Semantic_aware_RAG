  "explanation": "The line 'print(In*5)' is incorrect because it calculates the index of the nearest distance but does not provide the actual position of the water station. To correct this, we should use 'print(closest_station)' to directly print the nearest water station's position. The issue is associated with how the position of the water station is being calculated based on the minimum distance. The changes align similarly to the patches discovered that adjust indexing logic.",
  "fixed_code": "N=int(input())\nlist=[]\nfor i in range(21):\n  list.append(abs(N-i*5))\nIn=list.index(min(list))\nclosest_station = In * 5\nprint(closest_station)"

  "explanation": "The program incorrectly loops from 0 to 62 instead of 0 to 63, leading to an off-by-one error in the calculation. I corrected the loop to iterate up to and including 63 by changing 'range(63)' to 'range(64)'. This correction aligns with the need to account for all elements in the input list of size 64, ensuring the correct calculation as specified in the problem statement.",
  "fixed_code": "import sys\ninput = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 0\nfor i in range(64):\n    if a[i] == 0:\n        continue\n    else:\n        ans += (2 ** i)\nprint(ans)"

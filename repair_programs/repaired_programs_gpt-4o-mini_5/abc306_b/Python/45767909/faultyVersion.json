{
  "explanation": "The incorrect line mistakenly computes the answer by raising 2 to the value of A[i], which is either 0 or 1, rather than using the index 'i' as the exponent. I fixed it by changing 'ans += A[i] * 2 ** A[i]' to 'ans += A[i] * 2 ** i'. This change correctly computes the contribution of each bit to the final sum based on its position, as indicated in the problem statement. This is inspired by Diff 2, which also indicated a structure where proper indexing is crucial.",
  "fixed_code": "A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 0\nfor i in range(64):\n  ans += A[i] * 2 ** i\nprint(ans)"

  "explanation": "The issue was with the determination of the index of the youngest person. The program was using a zero-based index (INDEX=i) which caused it to misalign the seating order when printing names. By changing the line to use (i+1) instead of i, we can correctly identify the index of the youngest person in a one-based index manner. This fix is inspired by the obvious indexing errors found in Diff 1 and the understanding of how Python uses zero-based indexing while the problem assumes one-based positions.",

  "explanation": "The original line checks for contradictions using a single condition for 'W', 'L', and 'D', but does not properly evaluate the scenarios where the outcomes are not as expected. The correct logic should check for contradictions separately for each match outcome instead of skipping them. This aligns with the idea that if Player i beats Player j, then Player j should not have won against Player i. My adjustment made this distinction clear and fixed the logic. This was not directly referenced in the diffs, but the need for clearer checks aligns with the patterns of resolving logical conditions.",

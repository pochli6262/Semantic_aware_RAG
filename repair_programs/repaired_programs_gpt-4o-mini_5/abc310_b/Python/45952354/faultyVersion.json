  "explanation": "The original line incorrectly checks 'P[i] >= P[i]' instead of comparing 'P[i]' to 'P[j]'. This was likely an oversight that caused the condition to always be true. This issue is noted in the problem summary, and the fix is reflected in Diff 1, which suggests that the comparison should be 'P[i] >= P[j]'. I corrected the comparison in the conditional check.",

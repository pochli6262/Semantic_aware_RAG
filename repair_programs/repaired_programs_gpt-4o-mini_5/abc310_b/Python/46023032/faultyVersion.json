  "explanation": "The original line incorrectly checks if 'Fi < Fj', which should verify that 'Fj' includes at least one function that 'Fi' lacks to establish strict superiority. This was corrected by replacing 'Fi < Fj' with 'Fj > Fi', ensuring that at least one function in product j is not present in product i. This change aligns with the requirements outlined in the problem statement. The correction was inspired by the reasoning in Diff 1.",

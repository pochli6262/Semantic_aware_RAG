  "explanation": "The line calculating the number of attacks incorrectly adds 1 to the result of integer division, which causes incorrect results when A is a multiple of B. The correct approach is to use the ceiling of the division result, which can be implemented using the expression (A + B - 1) // B. This fix is inspired by the need for accurate counting of attacks and is commonly addressed in similar division issues, though it is not specifically referenced in the provided diffs.",
  "fixed_code": "A,B = map(int,input().split())\nprint((A + B - 1) // B)"

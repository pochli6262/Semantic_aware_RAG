{
  "explanation": "The original line 'print(int(x/y)+1)' incorrectly assumes that the result of integer division gives the correct number of attacks needed. It fails to account for the case where there is a remainder, which means we may need an additional attack. To fix it, I replaced this line with 'print((x + y - 1) // y)', which uses the ceiling division method to ensure we round up whenever there's a remainder. This fix is indirectly inspired by the requirement to accurately calculate the number of attacks based on the given stamina and damage rather than just performing a straightforward division.",
  "fixed_code": "x, y = map(int, input().split())\nprint((x + y - 1) // y)"

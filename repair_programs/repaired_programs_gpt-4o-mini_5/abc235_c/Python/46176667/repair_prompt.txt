## Problem Description (from dataset)
Score : 300 points

### Problem Statement

We have a sequence of N numbers: A = (a\_1, a\_2, \dots, a\_N).  
Process the Q queries explained below.

* Query i: You are given a pair of integers (x\_i, k\_i). Let us look at the elements of A one by one from the beginning: a\_1, a\_2, \dots Which element will be the k\_i-th occurrence of the number x\_i?  
  Print the index of that element, or -1 if there is no such element.

### Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq a\_i \leq 10^9 (1 \leq i \leq N)
* 0 \leq x\_i \leq 10^9 (1 \leq i \leq Q)
* 1 \leq k\_i \leq N (1 \leq i \leq Q)
* All values in input are integers.

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N Q
a_1 a_2 \dots a_N
x_1 k_1
x_2 k_2
\vdots
x_Q k_Q
```

### Output

Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the answer to Query i.

### Sample Input 1

```
6 8
1 1 2 3 1 2
1 1
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 1
2 2
2 3
4 1
```

### Sample Output 1

```
1
2
5
-1
3
6
-1
-1
```

1 occurs in A at a\_1, a\_2, a\_5. Thus, the answers to Query 1 through 4 are 1, 2, 5, -1 in this order.

### Sample Input 2

```
3 2
0 1000000000 999999999
1000000000 1
123456789 1
```

### Sample Output 2

```
2
-1
```

## Your Analysis (1-sentence bug summary)
The likely bug is that the program returns a 1-based index for occurrences rather than the expected 0-based index when looking up the k-th occurrence.

## Buggy Program
import sys
from collections import defaultdict
MOD = 998_244_353
INF = 10**18

N, Q = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
A = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().rstrip().split()))
D = defaultdict(list)
for i in range(N):
    D[A[i]].append(i + 1)

print(D)

for q in range(Q):
    x, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().rstrip().split()))
    if len(D[x]) >= k:
        print(D[x][k - 1])
    else:
        print(-1)

Your task:
1) Identify the single incorrect line according to the problem summary and the retrieved diffs.
2) Assume EXACTLY ONE line is wrong.
3) Provide the corrected version of the ENTIRE program, changing only that single line â€” all other lines must remain identical.
4) Do not restructure or rewrite unrelated code.
5) Respond ONLY in JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "Explain what was wrong in that single line and how you fixed it (mention which diff patterns inspired the fix if applicable).",
  "fixed_code": "The FULL program with only that ONE line corrected."
}

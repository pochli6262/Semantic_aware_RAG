### Problem Statement

Given are permutations P=(P\_1,P\_2,\cdots,P\_N) and Q=(Q\_1,Q\_2,\cdots,Q\_N) of (1,2,\cdots,N).

Snuke is going to extract (not necessarily contiguous) subsequences from P and Q.
Here, the subsequences must satisfy the conditions below.

* The length of the subsequence extracted from P and that extracted from Q are the same. Below, let k be this length.
* Let a=(a\_1,a\_2,\cdots,a\_k) and b=(b\_1,b\_2,\cdots,b\_k) be the subsequences extracted from P and Q, respectively.
  Then, for each 1 \leq i \leq k, b\_i is a multiple of a\_i.

Find the maximum possible length of each subsequence extracted by Snuke.

### Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 200000
* P is a permutation of (1,2,\cdots,N).
* Q is a permutation of (1,2,\cdots,N).
* All values in input are integers.

### Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N
P_1 P_2 \cdots P_N
Q_1 Q_2 \cdots Q_N
```

### Output

Print the answer.

### Sample Input 1

```
4
3 1 4 2
4 2 1 3
```

### Sample Output 1

```
2
```

If we extract the subsequence (1,2) from P and (4,2) from Q, they satisfy the conditions.
It is impossible to extract subsequences of length 3 or greater to satisfy the conditions, so the answer is 2.

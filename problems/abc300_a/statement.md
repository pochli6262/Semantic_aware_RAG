### Problem Statement

Given integers A and B, find A+B.  
This is a N-choice problem; the i-th choice is C\_i.  
Print the **index** of the correct choice.

### Constraints

* All values in the input are integers.
* 1 \le N \le 300
* 1 \le A,B \le 1000
* 1 \le C\_i \le 2000
* C\_i are pairwise distinct. In other words, no two choices have the same value.
* There is exactly one i such that A+B=C\_i. In other words, there is always a unique correct choice.

### Sample Input 1

```
3 125 175
200 300 400
```

### Sample Output 1

```
2
```

We have 125+175 = 300.  
The first, second, and third choices are 200, 300, and 400, respectively.  
Thus, the 2-nd choice is correct, so 2 should be printed.

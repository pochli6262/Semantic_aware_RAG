### Problem Statement

You are given a simple connected undirected graph G with N vertices and M edges.  
The vertices and edges of G are numbered as vertex 1, vertex 2, \ldots, vertex N, and edge 1, edge 2, \ldots, edge M, respectively, and edge i (1\leq i\leq M) connects vertices U\_i and V\_i.

You are also given distinct vertices A,B,C on G.
Determine if there is a simple path connecting vertices A and C via vertex B.

What is a simple connected undirected graph?
A graph G is said to be a simple connected undirected graph when G is an undirected graph that is simple and connected.  
A graph G is said to be an undirected graph when the edges of G have no direction.  
A graph G is simple when G does not contain self-loops or multi-edges.  
A graph G is connected when one can travel between all vertices of G via edges.

What is a simple path via vertex Z?
For vertices X and Y on a graph G, a simple path connecting X and Y is a sequence of distinct vertices (v\_1,v\_2,\ldots,v\_k) such that v\_1=X, v\_k=Y, and for every integer i satisfying 1\leq i\leq k-1, there is an edge on G connecting vertices v\_i and v\_{i+1}.  
A simple path (v\_1,v\_2,\ldots,v\_k) is said to be via vertex Z when there is an i (2\leq i\leq k-1) satisfying v\_i=Z.

```

### Sample Output 1

```
Yes
```

One simple path connecting vertices 1 and 2 via vertex 3 is 1 \to 5 \to 4 \to 3 \to 2.

Thus, print `Yes`.

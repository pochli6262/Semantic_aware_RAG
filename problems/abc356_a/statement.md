### Problem Statement

You are given positive integers N, L, and R.  
For a sequence A = (1, 2, \dots, N) of length N, an operation of reversing the L-th through R-th elements was performed once.  
Print the sequence after this operation.

### Constraints

* All input values are integers.
* 1 \leq L \leq R \leq N \leq 100

---

### Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

```
N L R
```

### Output

Let A' = (A'\_1, A'\_2, \dots, A'\_N) be the sequence after the operation. Print it in the following format:

```
A'_1 A'_2 \dots A'_N
```

---

### Sample Input 1

```
5 2 3
```

### Sample Output 1

```
1 3 2 4 5
```

Initially, A = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
After reversing the second through third elements, the sequence becomes (1, 3, 2, 4, 5), which should be printed.

### Sample Input 2

```
7 1 1
```

### Sample Output 2

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

It is possible that L = R.

### Sample Input 3

```
10 1 10
```

### Sample Output 3

```
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```

It is possible that L = 1 or R = N.

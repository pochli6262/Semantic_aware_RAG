Score : 525 points

### Problem Statement

There is a connected undirected graph with N vertices and M edges, where the i-th edge connects vertex U\_i and vertex V\_i bidirectionally.  
Each vertex has an integer written on it, with integer A\_v written on vertex v.

For a simple path from vertex 1 to vertex N (a path that does not pass through the same vertex multiple times), the score is determined as follows:

* Let S be the sequence of integers written on the vertices along the path, listed in the order they are visited.
* If S is not non-decreasing, the score of that path is 0.
* Otherwise, the score is the number of distinct integers in S.

Find the path from vertex 1 to vertex N with the highest score among all simple paths and print that score.

 What does it mean for S to be non-decreasing?
A sequence S=(S\_1,S\_2,\dots,S\_l) of length l is said to be non-decreasing if and only if S\_i \le S\_{i+1} for all integers 1 \le i < l.

### Constraints

* All input values are integers.
* 2 \le N \le 2 \times 10^5
* N-1 \le M \le 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \le A\_i \le 2 \times 10^5
* The graph is connected.
* 1 \le U\_i < V\_i \le N
* (U\_i,V\_i) \neq (U\_j,V\_j) if i \neq j.

### Sample Input 1

```
5 6
10 20 30 40 50
1 2
1 3
2 5
3 4
3 5
4 5
```

### Sample Output 1

```
4
```

The path 1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5 has S=(10,30,40,50) for a score of 4, which is the maximum.

### Sample Input 2

```
4 5
1 10 11 4
1 2
1 3
2 3
2 4
3 4
```

### Sample Output 2

```
0
```

There is no simple path from vertex 1 to vertex N such that S is non-decreasing. In this case, the maximum score is 0.
